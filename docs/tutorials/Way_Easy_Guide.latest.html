<h1>Colin's Way Easy Intro Guide to MOO Programming</h1>

<p></p><h3>Version 2.2<br>March 1996</h3>
<p>
<i>by Colin McCormick (a.k.a. Snowfall)<br>colin@tripod.com</i><br>

</p><p></p><hr>

</center>

<p></p><h2>0.0) Silly Foreword</h2><p>

	This document is for free distribution.  If you have a
brilliant idea for how to make it into truly monumental cybernetic
scripture (or just have a comment, question or flame) <a href="mailto:colin@tripod.com">let me know</a>.  Personal cheques are
also welcome.  The <i>Way Easy Guide</i> is intended to teach basic
programming concepts and methods, so if you already understand how to
code a MOO for loop or build a recursive daemon wanderer, allow me
direct you to Pavel Curtis' <i>LambdaMOO Programmer's Guide</i>,
available at <a href="ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/MOO/">
parcftp.xerox.com/pub/MOO/ProgrammersManual.*</a>.  There are a number
of elements of MOO programming that I have omitted in the interests of
time and personal sanity; Pavel's guide is significantly more
complete.</p><p>

You may also be interested, as an intermediary document, in my <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Snowfall/Way_Easy_Examples.latest.html"><i>Way
Easy MOO Programming Examples</i></a>, a series of building and
programming examples spelled out in (I hope) straightforward steps.

</p><p></p><h3>0.1) Special Note for HereMOO Programmers</h3><p>

	<a href="http://trickle.tripod.com/">HereMOO</a> is
revolutionary among MOOs in its Web-based implementation.  All
programming techniques on standard MOOs will work on HereMOO, but
there are a few non-standard things one can do as well.  The most
relevant of these is the fact that HTML tags can be written directly
into descriptions or even into spoken/emoted text.  Thus by typing

</p><pre>	@describe me as "A &lt;B&gt;great&lt;/B&gt; guy!" </pre>

other people, when looking at you, will see:<p>

</p><pre>A <b>great</b> guy!<p></p></pre>

You could also type

<pre>	say Melanie, you look &lt;I&gt;marvelous&lt;/I&gt; tonight!</pre>

and, on the MOO, everyone will see:<p>

</p><pre>Colin says, "Melanie, you look <i>marvelous</i> tonight!</pre>

This technique will also work for adding images, links, lists, etc. to
your description and the description of your room and objects.<p>

For help with HTML, check out NCSA's <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html">
<i>Beginner's Guide to HTML</i></a>.</p><p>

For more complicated HTML tricks on HereMOO (including <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#link_command"> how to use a link to send a command to the
MOO</a> and <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#own_images">how to add images of your own to
your description</a>) see <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#html_tricks">below</a>.

<p></p><h2>1.0) Introduction</h2><p>
	
	This book is for aspiring MOO code programmers and other lower
vertebrates, except sheep.  MOO code, for all its power and
flexibility, is really quite easy to learn (except for sheep.)  To
read this book you will have to know basic elements of the MOO
environment and commands, but not much else, and by the time you
finish you should have a good grasp of the elements of MOO
programming, how to create and edit verbs, and the basics of the MOO
language.</p><p>

	One note before we begin.  In order to do most of the examples
in this guide, you need to have been made a programmer on your MOO.
Most MOO wizards will do this upon request, with a smile and free of
charge.  If you try some of the following examples and get errors like
"E_VERBNF (Verb not found)" or "E_PERM (Permission Denied)" make sure
that you are a programmer before proceeding, unless you're a sheep, in
which case there's just no hope.</p><p>

Ovine-less ones, read on!

</p><p></p><h3>1.1) Object Orientation</h3><p>

	To program on a MOO, one must first understand the concept of
an <i>object-oriented</i> data structure.  Everything that exists on a
MOO is an <i>object</i> that has a unique <i>object number</i>.  These
objects are organized into a sort of genealogical hierarchy, with the
Root Object (#1) at the top and its "children", "grandchildren", etc.
branching down from it.  The nifty thing about this is that every
object automatically <i>inherits</i> all of the characteristics
(i.e. properties and verbs) of its parent, and, by extension, of all
of its ancestors back to #1.

</p><p></p><h3>1.2) Inheritance</h3><p>

	Inheritance is useful in programming in that it allows for the
creation of <i>classes</i> of objects.  If we wished to create (for
instance) a refrigerator, a backpack and a kangaroo pouch, we could
first make a generic "container" object that could hold other objects
and recognize such commands as <i>open</i>, <i>close</i>, and
<i>lock</i>.  Then we could create three children of this generic
container (customizing them to look like a refrigerator, a backpack
and a kangaroo pouch) and they would all function as containers that
could be opened, closed and locked, without having to reprogram each
one individually.  Most MOOs are organized around this idea, and there
are many generic items available to use as parents.  (For a complete
list, ask the resident wizards.) </p><p>

	To see the children or parent of an object, type 

</p><pre>	@kids <i>object name</i>
	@parent <i>object name</i> </pre>

<p></p><h3>1.3) Referring to Objects</h3><p>

	Objects are refered to in MOO code by their object number,
preceded by the number symbol (<b>#</b>).  Hence, the Root Object is
#1, and the next object made will be #2, etc.  One of the best ways to
find object numbers is the <tt>@contents</tt> command.  To see the
names and object numbers of the objects in your room, for instance,
type <tt>@contents here</tt>.  To see your own contents (the items you
are holding), type <tt>@contents me</tt>.

<p></p><h2>2.0) Properties</h2><p>

	Now that we've established the idea of objects and their
hierarchy, let's talk about what you can do with them.  Objects can
have <i>properties</i> and <i>verbs</i> defined on them.
<i>Properties</i> are chunks of data that have four possible data
types (or "flavours") while <i>verbs</i> are MOO-code programs.
Properties are more straightforward, so we'll start with them.

</p><p></p><h3>2.1) Properties and their Flavours</h3><p>

	Properties can hold any data you wish.  Some properties,
defined on #1 and thus inherited by all objects, characterize an
object in the MOO's virtual reality; among these are the "name",
"location" and "contents" properties.  Others may be used by you, the
programmer, to hold the value of (say) the number of sandwiches left
in a sandwich vending machine, or a list of possible phrases your pet
parrot might say.  There are four valid data types for properties;
they are:

</p><ul>
<li><i>Numbers</i> -- any integer value, positive, negative or zero</li>
<li><i>Strings</i> -- any group of text characters (can include numbers, but
they will be treated as text)</li>
<li><i>Lists</i> -- a list of any number of "elements", which can be numbers,
strings, other lists or object numbers</li>
<li><i>Object numbers</i></li>
</ul>

Strings must be surrounded by quotes (") and lists by curly brackets
({}) with their elements delimited by commas (,).  All elements in a
list must be of the same data type.  For example, <tt>{"this", "is",
"a", "list"}</tt> and <tt>{{1, "hi"}, {2, "there"}, {3, "bob"}}</tt>
are both valid properties.

<p></p><h3>2.2) Referring to Properties</h3><p>

	Properties are referred to as '<tt>object number.property
name</tt>' -- i.e., the name property of the Root Object is '#1.name',
and its location property is '#1.location'.  To see the value of any
property, just type its reference (without quotes), preceded by the
<i>evaluation operator</i>, ";":

</p><pre>	;#1.name
	=&gt; "Root Class"</pre>

The evaluation operator (;) is used to find the value of any reference
or MOO code expression.  It is a very powerful programming tool, but
has the drawback that it can only recognize objects by number, not by
name or alias.

<p></p><h3>2.3) Creating and Removing Properties</h3><p>

	To create a new property, use the <tt>@property</tt> command:

</p><pre>	@property me.nickname "Crazy Caboola"

	@property #123.flowers = {"iris", "rose", "daisy"}</pre>

(You may abbreviate this as <tt>@prop</tt>.)  The first command will
create a property on you (remember, <em>everything</em> is an object,
including you) called "nickname" and give it the value "Crazy
Caboola", a string.  The second will create a property on object #123
called "flowers" with the value {"iris", "rose", "daisy"}, a list.
Property names must not contain spaces (use the underscore "_" for
property names like "sandwiches_left".)<p>

It's worth noting at this point that if you don't <i>own</i> the
object onto which you are attempting to define a property, the MOO
probably won't let you define it.  We'll return to the topic of
ownership and permissions <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#permissions">later</a>; for now
try examples on yourself or objects you've created.</p><p>

If no initial value is specified in <tt>@property</tt>, it will
default to 0, a number.  Be careful about this, because if you create
a property and give it no initial value, and later try to change the
value of that property to a string, a list or an object number, the
MOO will become confused and you will have to remove the property and
start again.  If you are creating a blank property that you know will
eventually be a string, list or object number, give it an initial
value of <tt>""</tt> (the empty string), <tt>{}</tt> (the empty list)
or #-1 (a default "nothing" object.)</p><p>

	To remove a property, use the <tt>@rmproperty</tt> command:

</p><pre>	@rmproperty me.flowers</pre>

(You may also abbreviate this as <tt>@rmprop</tt>.)<p>

	To list all properties <em>explicitly</em> defined on an
object (the ones implicitly defined on it because of inheritance are
difficult to list -- do the following for each parent on up the object
tree) use:

</p><pre>	;properties(#1)</pre>

<p></p><h3>2.4) Changing and Viewing Property Values</h3><p>

	Object inheritance includes properties, and the initial values
of these properties are the same as those of the object's parent,
except for certain key properties such as "name", "location" and
"owner".  Both inherited and explicity defined properties you own can
be changed by the <tt>@set</tt> command:

</p><pre>	@set me.nickname to "A Dyspeptic Aardvark"</pre>

In order to see the value of a given property, you can either use the
evaluation operator (;) if you know the object number of the object on
which the property is defined, or you can use the <tt>@display</tt>
command:

<pre>@display me.nickname
.nickname     Colin (#123)       r c    "A Dyspeptic Aardvark"</pre>

The name, owner and value of the property are displayed, as well as
its "permission bits", which we will discuss <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#permissions">later</a>.  <tt>@display</tt> may be abbreviated as
<tt>@disp</tt>.

<p></p><h2>3.0) Verbs</h2><p>

	Verbs are the best part of a MOO.  They are what make people
able to <em>do</em> things - hence their name.  A verb is a short
program, written in MOO code and "defined on" (assigned to) some
object.  (Remember that this means the verb is implicitly defined on
all of this object's children, as well.)  Examples of verbs include
<i>look</i>, <i>get</i>, and <i>floccinaucinihilipillificate</i>.  The
greater the quantity and quality of verbs that are defined, the more
complex and engaging the MOO's virtual reality becomes.  


</p><p></p><h3>3.1) Verb Syntax</h3><p>

	All MOO verbs not involving the evalulation operator (also
claled "eval") are structured in the following way:

</p><pre>(verb) (direct object) (preposition) (indirect object)</pre>

The three <i>arguments</i> (direct object, preposition and indirect object)
are optional, and can be used in any combination to suit the form of
the verb.  For instance:

<pre>	spill sewage on Yog-Shaggoth</pre>

uses all three optional arguments, while

<pre>	harass Cobweb</pre>

uses only one, the direct object.  It is important to figure out how
you want a verb to be typed in by players before you write it; make
sure that you have all the information typed in that the verb will
need (i.e. you need to know on whom to spill the sewage, and also what
to spill in the first place!)  Be aware that if an object other than a
player or a room has a verb defined on it, the name of that object
<b>must</b> be one of the arguments.  Otherwise, the MOO doesn't know
what object to find the verb on!

<p></p><h3>3.2) Creating Verbs</h3><p>

	The first step to writing a verb (after you have figured out
its syntax) is to create it on a particular object.  Usually this
object will be some nifty toy or tool you've already created using
<tt>@create</tt>, but you can also define verbs on yourself and any
room you own.  Verbs on yourself will always be usable by you, but
never by anyone else (unless they copy the verb to themselves.)  Verbs
on a room are usable when standing in the room, but not anywhere else.
Verbs defined on any other object will only be usable if you are
holding that object or if it is in the same room as you.</p><p>

	To create an (unprogrammed) verb on an object, use the
<tt>@verb</tt> command:

</p><pre>	@verb object:verb name d.o. prep i.o</pre>

You must specify the object on which the verb is to be defined, the
name of the verb, and its arguments (if any.)  Objects can be
specified either by their object number or by their name (or alias) if
they are in your possession or in the same room as you.<p>

	Argument specifications are of the following form: for the
direct object and indirect object, you may choose <i>this</i> (the
name or number of this object must be typed in with the command);
<i>any</i> (any valid object name or number must be typed in with the
command) or <i>none</i> (no [in]direct object name or number is
required.)  Valid prepositions are pretty straightforward: (<i>on</i>,
<i>at</i>, <i>with</i>, <i>over</i>, etc.)  A full list can be seen by
typing <tt>help preposition</tt>.  Examples of two valid verb
creations:

</p><pre>	@verb #231:chuck this at any

	@verb loins:gird this none none</pre>

The first command creates the verb <i>chuck</i> on object #231.
<i>chuck</i> expects to see a command like <tt>chuck #231 at
Melia</tt>.  The second command creates the verb <i>gird</i> on the
object <i>loins</i>.  <i>gird</i> expects to see a command line like
<tt>gird loins</tt>.  The object number, name and alias are
interchangeable as long as you are either holding the object or it is
in the same room as you.

<p></p><h3>3.3) Correcting Verb Arguments</h3><p>

	If you realize after creating a verb that you have specified
the wrong arguments, use the <tt>@args</tt> command to correct it:

</p><pre>	@args loins:gird this with any</pre>

<i>loins:gird</i> now expects to see something like <tt>gird loins
with magnesium</tt>.

<p></p><h3>3.4) Removing/Renaming Verbs</h3><p>

	To delete a verb that you don't want, the command is
<tt>@rmbverb object number:verb name</tt>.  To rename a verb, the
command is <tt>@rename object number:old verb name to new verb
name</tt>.  To see a list of all the verbs defined on an object, type
<tt>@verbs (object)</tt>.</p><p>

	Finally, to see all the verbs explicitly defined on an object, type

</p><pre>	;verbs(<i>object number</i>)</pre><p>

<a name="permissions"></a>

<p></p><h2>4.0) Permissions</h2><p>

	As with most human systems, MOO employs a system of ownership
to keep track of who can do what to what.  This system is somewhat
complex, but the basic rule of thumb is: <b>if you made it, you own
it, and you can do anything you want to it.</b> If you're in a hurry
to get to programming, <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#programming">skip on ahead</a>, but
it's a good idea to understand permissions if you want your verbs to
interact with other players.</p><p>

</p><p></p><h3>4.1) Overview</h3><p>

	Each object, property and verb has an owner, specified in its
"owner" property.  When a new object, property or verb is created, the
player who creates it is the owner unless otherwise specified.  All
players have an "owned_objects" property that is a list of the objects
they own; unfortunately, no such system exists for keeping track of
the properties or verbs one owns, which can occasionally cause
problems.</p><p>

	In addition to an owner, objects, properties and verbs all
have a set of permission bits that specify what everyone other than
their owner may do to them (owners have no restrictions on what they
may do to their objects.  Calm down, Melanie.)  These permissions are
similar to those on UNIX filesystems, and are stored as a string of
characters.  The possible characters, or "bits" for objects,
properties and verbs are different, and will be discussed in turn.</p><p>

	The best way of viewing a property or verb's owner and
permission bits is the <tt>@display</tt> command, mentioned above.

</p><pre>	@display me.nickname

	@display me:run</pre>

The best way of viewing an object's owner and permission bits is the
<tt>@examine</tt> command:

<pre>	@examine me

	@examine #100</pre>

We'll start by discussing property permissions.

<p></p><h3>4.2) Property Permissions</h3><p>

	The permission bits for properties are drawn from the
following set:

</p><ul>

<li><tt>r</tt> -- the property is "readable", meaning others can use
<tt>@disply</tt> to see its value</li>

<li><tt>w</tt> -- the property is "writable", meaning others can
change its value, using <tt>@set</tt></li>

<li><tt>c</tt> -- the inherited version of this property on a child
object will change ownership to the creator of the child</li>

</ul>

A permission bit string can have zero, one, two or all three of these
characters in it.  For example, a permission bit string "rc" means
that the property is readable by everyone, writable (changable) only
by its owner, and the inherited version of the property on any
children of the object will be owned by the child object's creator.
This latter property is particularly important for wizard-owned
objects that become generics.  The default permission string for
properties created with <tt>@property</tt> is "rc".<p>

As a side note, it's a good idea to avoid writable properties where
possible.  There's no reason for other people to be able to change
your data, and if you rely on the propety to give information to some
of your verbs, you have no guarantee that those verbs will continue to
work from day to day.

</p><p></p><h3>4.3) Verb Permissions</h3><p>

	Verb permission strings are drawn from the following set:

</p><ul>

<li><tt>r</tt> -- the verb's code is readable by everyone, by using
<tt>@list</tt></li>

<li><tt>w</tt> -- the verb's code is writable by everyone, by using
<tt>@edit</tt></li>

<li><tt>x</tt> -- the verb is executable, and may be called from
within another verb

</li><li><tt>d</tt> -- the verb is set for debugging; if it encounters an
error in execution it will print a "traceback" description of the
error</li>

</ul>

Writable verbs are very dangerous, as they allow any programmer to
issue commands as if he/she were you, by editing the verb's code.  The
default permission string for verbs is "rd", but if a verb is
specified with the arguments "this none this" then it will have the
permission string "rxd", which is useful when creating verbs that are
to be called from within other verbs.

<p></p><h3>4.4) Object Permissions</h3><p>

	Object permission strings are in fact not exactly that -- they
are individual properties called "r", "w", and "f", and are either 1
or 0 (true or false).  Still, you can think of them as a string, as
the <tt>@chmod</tt> command (see below) will accept them as a string.
Their meanings are:

</p><ul>

<li><tt>r</tt> -- the object is readable: anyone may list the
properties and verbs defined on the object, using
<tt>;properties()</tt> and <tt>;verbs()</tt></li>

<li><tt>w</tt> -- the object is writable: anyone may define properties
or verbs on it using <tt>@property</tt> and <tt>@verb</tt></li>

<li><tt>f</tt> -- the object is fertile: anyone may create a child of
it using <tt>@create</tt></li>

</ul>

Again, writable objects are to be avoided unless there's a good reason
for them.  Since no concise list of the properties and verbs you own
is kept, it's easy to lose track of verbs and properties stored on
objects you don't own.

<p></p><h3>4.5) Changing Permissions</h3><p>

	To change the permission bit string of a property or object,
use the <tt>@chmod</tt> command:

</p><pre>	@chmod me.nickname "rwc"

	@chmod me:run "rxd"

	@chmod me "rw"</pre>

The first of these commands means that anyone on the MOO (who is a
programmer) can read and change your nickname property; plus, if
anyone creates a child of you, they will own the inherited version of
the nickname property.  The second command means that anyone can list
the code of the "run" verb (which we assume for the moment is a verb
defined on you); it can be called from within another verb, and it
will print traceback error messages if something goes wrong during its
execution.  Finally, the third command means that anyone can see what
properties and verbs you have defined on you, and anyone can define a
new property or verb on you (which they will own.)<p>

As a final emphasis, <b>beware of writable propeties, verbs and
objects</b>.  If there's no good reason for them to be writable, don't
make them so.

<a name="programming"></a>

<p></p><h2>5.0) Programming Verbs</h2><p>

	Once a verb has been created and all its arguments are
correct, all that remains is to program it.  No sweat!  The command to
program a verb is:

</p><pre>	@edit <i>object:verb</i></pre>

This will move you to the Verb Editor, a special room where you can
edit your verb line by line.  Since the Verb Editor is every
programmer's best friend, it behooves us to briefly mention the
commands therein.

<p></p><h3>5.1) The Verb Editor</h3><p>

	When you arrive in the Verb Editor, you will see a list of
commands.  Typing <tt>look</tt> at any time will also give you this
list.  The important ones are:

</p><ul>
<li><i>say (line)</i>: add a line at the current insertion point</li>
<li><i>list</i>: list the lines of your verb, with line numbers</li>
<li><i>delete #</i> - delete line number #</li>
<li><i>insert #</i> - make the current insert point before line # (to insert
at the end, use a dollar sign <tt>$</tt> instead of a number)</li>
<li><i>move #a to #b</i> - move line #a to before line #b</li>
</ul>

Two other non-editing commands are important:

<ul>
<li><i>compile</i> - compile your verb (translate the MOO code lines into a
binary program that the computer can execute)</li>
<li><i>quit</i> - quit and return to your previous location</li>
</ul>

N.B. -- you must compile your verb in order to it to work.  Compile
after each version of the verb is completed.  If you don't compile,
the next time you use <tt>@edit</tt>, the Verb Editor will ask if you want to
continue to work on the last (uncompiled) verb or throw it away. 

<p></p><h3>5.2) Programming Verbs (for real)</h3><p>

	MOO verb code looks a lot like C (don't panic!)  It is easy
and practical to learn, and may even serve as a good introduction to
learning other computer languages.  A sample bit of MOO code looks
like:

</p><pre>	player:tell("You take a cookie from the jar.");
	player.location:announce(player.name, " takes a cookie from
the cookie jar and eyes it hungrily.");
	if (player.name == "Cookie Monster")
	     player:tell("You wolf down the cookie with gusto.");
	     player.location:announce(player.name, " gobbles up the
cookie with no regard for decorum.  You are splattered with crumbs.");
	else
	     player:tell("You delicately nibble at the cookie.");
	     player.location:announce(player.name, " demurely nibbles
at the cookie and politely cleans up the crumbs.");
	endif
</pre>

The code is executed line by line, except in the event of <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#flow_control">flow control</a> commands, which will be discussed
later.  Every line (except the aforementioned flow control commands)
must be followed by a semi-colon (;).  While simple verbs are easy to
keep track of, you may want to make flow charts or other sketches of
more complicated verbs before leaping right into writing them.

<p></p><h3>5.3) The First Verb</h3><p>

	The first verb to try, of course, is a simple one.  Without
barely more knowledge than what we already have we can write a simple
verb, that will say something back to us when we type it in.  The two
most important MOO code commands you will ever know are the following:

</p><pre>	player:tell("Immanuel Kant was a real pissant...");
	player.location:announce("...who was very rarely stable...");
</pre>

The former tells the player who has called the verb (typed the verb
name as a command) whatever is in the quotes.  The latter tells every
other player in the calling player's room whatever is in <em>its</em>
quotes.  The above two lines, if written and compiled as a verb named
"bruce", would do the following: by typing <tt>bruce</tt>, the player
would see the words:

<pre>Immanuel Kant was a real pissant...</pre>

and the other players in room would see:

<pre>...who was very rarely stable...</pre>

This may not seem like a big deal, but considering that you can make
the words in the parentheses anything you want, it can get fairly
interesting.  Also, you needn't have just text in the parentheses: you
may also place property references or variables in the parentheses.
For example:

<pre>	player:tell("Your name is ", player.name, " and the value of
the variable \"count\" is ", count, ".");</pre>

will display to the calling player something like:

<pre>Your name is Griselde, and the value of the variable "count" is
1293.</pre>

	Note that the various components of the sentence are separated
by commas.  The expression '\"' prints out a quote sign in the
sentence (a single quote " will be interpreted as the end of the text
string!)<p>

<i>(Technical Note: the lines </i><tt>player:tell(...)</tt><i> and
</i><tt>player.location:announce(..)</tt><i> aren't actually MOO
commands.  They instruct the MOO to call other verbs, either
</i>tell<i> or </i>announce<i>, that are defined on the objects
</i>player<i> and </i>player.location<i>, i.e. a room.  These
particular verbs derive from the LambdaCore database distribution, and
a very few MOOs will not have them.  If these lines fail to work on
your MOO, contact your wizards for assistance.)</i>

</p><p></p><h3>5.4) Congratulations...</h3><p>

	...you can now write simple MOO verbs!  Okay, so they're not
anything to get hot and bothered about, but they're a start.  With
some general refinements, we can start writing interesting and
complicated verbs that will be the envy of other players for miles
around.</p><p>

</p><hr>

<p></p><h2>6.0) (Slightly) More Complicated Verb Programming</h2><p>

	The most interesting and complicated verbs are ones that
respond differently to different conditions: who is calling it, where
that player is, what time it is, etc.  This can be accomplished with
variables and flow control statements.  We've already used one
variable unwittingly (<i>player</i>, above), so we're halfway there
already.

</p><p></p><h3>6.1) Variables</h3><p>

	Variables are changeable bits of data that are used only while
the verb is being executed.  Each variable has a name and a value. All
verbs begin with certain pre-defined variables that can be used
without any initializing statements.  The more useful of these are:

</p><ul>
<li><i>player</i> - the object number of the player who called this verb</li>
<li><i>this</i> - the object number of the object on which the verb is
defined</li>
<li><i>verb</i> - the name of the verb</li>
<li><i>dobjstr</i> - the direct object string</li>
<li><i>iobjstr</i> - the indirect object string</li>
<li><i>prepstr</i> - the preposition string</li>
<li><i>args</i> - list made up of the given arguments, i.e. for the
command "slather honey on Kassandra", args = {"honey", "on", "Kassandra"}</li>
</ul>

	Any variable (including the predefined ones) can be created
and given a value or just given a new value by the equal sign ("="):

<pre>	count = 3;
	my_object = #143;
	old_character_name = "Rumplestiltskin";
</pre>

Variables may also be set equal to other variables in this way,
although a variable can never be set to a value of a different data
type than its original value.

<a name="flow_control"></a>

<p></p><h3>6.2) Flow Control</h3><p>

	Variables are most useful when they are used within a more
complex structure of execution than just one line after the next.  The
three basic flow control statements allow for lines to be executed in
a special order, depending on certain tests.  These statements are:

</p><pre>	if (<i>condition 1</i>)
		...
	elseif (<i>condition 2</i>)
		...
	else
		...
	endif


	while (<i>condition A</i>)
		...
	endwhile


	for <i>variable</i> in (<i>list or numerical interval</i>)
		...
	endfor
</pre>

The ellipses stand for an arbitrary number of lines, including zero.

<p></p><h4>6.2.1) The <tt>If</tt> Statement</h4><p>


</p><ul> 
<li>The <tt>if</tt> statement first tests <i>condition 1</i>. If
it is true then all the commands between it and the next
<tt>elseif</tt>, <tt>else</tt> or <tt>endif</tt> are executed, and
the whole <tt>if</tt> statement is over.</li>

<li>If <i>condition 1</i> is false, <i>condition 2</i> is tested.  If
it is true, all the commands between it and the <i>following</i>
<tt>elseif</tt>, <tt>else</tt> or <tt>endif</tt> are executed, and
the whole <tt>if</tt> statement is over.</li>

<li>If <i>condition 2</i> is false, or there was no <tt>elseif</tt>,
the statements between <tt>else</tt> and <tt>endif</tt> are executed,
and the whole <tt>if</tt> statement is over.  If there's no
<tt>else</tt>, nothing at all happens.</li>

</ul>

	You can have as many <tt>elseif</tt>s as you want; they are
tested in order (after the first <tt>if</tt>) from top to bottom.
Once one is judged true, the commands between it and the next are
executed, and the whole <tt>if</tt> statement is over.  You may have
one or zero <tt>else</tt>s, and you must have one and only one
<tt>endif</tt>.

<p></p><h4>6.2.2) The <tt>While</tt> Statement</h4><p>

	The <tt>while</tt> statement is simpler.  <i>condition A</i>
is tested, and if it is true all lines between <tt>while</tt> and
<tt>endwhile</tt> are executed.  <i>condition A</i> is then tested
again, and the same occurs.  Only once <i>condition A</i> is false
will the <tt>while</tt> statement be over.  Note that this can result
in an infinite loop.  Make sure that at least one of the lines after
<tt>while</tt> affects <i>condition A</i> so that it will eventually
be false.

</p><p></p><h4>6.2.3) The <tt>For</tt> Statement</h4><p>

	<tt>for</tt> looks at the list or numerical interval it has
been given, and sets <i>variable</i> equal to the first element or
number in the list or interval.  It then executes all lines until it
gets to the endfor, sets <i>variable</i> equal to the next element or
number in the list or interval, and repeats the process until it has
run through the entire list or interval.  Note: to specify a numerical
interval, the syntax is:

</p><pre>	for <i>variable</i> in [<i>number1</i>..<i>number2</i>]</pre>

with square brackets "[]" and two periods between the numbers
specifying the range.

<p></p><h4>6.2.4) Examples</h4><p>

	Some examples seem in order:

</p><pre>	snork = random(10);
	badsnork = 4;
	while (snork != badsnork)
	     player:tell("Snork number is still not ", badsnork, "!");
	     snork = random(10);
	endwhile

	for count in [1..10]
	     player:tell("The count is now ", count, ".");
	endfor

	if (player.name == "Dirtbag")
	     player:tell("You are a dirtbag.");
	else
	     player:tell("You are not a dirtbag.");
	endif
</pre>

The command <tt>random(x)</tt> generates a random integer from 1 to x.

<p></p><h3>6.3) Evaluation</h3><p>

	Conditions in flow loops are evaluated in reasonably
straightforward ways.  The following operators are important:

</p><ul>
<li>== (tests equality; <b>NOTE</b>: do not confuse this with =,
		which assigns a value to a variable!!!)</li>
<li>&lt;= (tests less than or equal to)</li>
<li>&gt;= (tests greater than or equal to)</li>
<li>&lt;  (tests less than)</li>
<li>&gt;  (tests greater than)</li>
<li>!= (tests inequality)</li>
</ul>

The following tests if a value is in a given list:

<pre>	<i>variable name</i> in (list)</pre>

The list or list name must be surrounded by parentheses.  Finally, the
logical operators are as follows:
	
<pre>	&amp;&amp; - and	|| - or </pre>

Thus <tt>(3 &lt;= 1 &amp;&amp; 10 == 2+8</tt> is false, while <tt>3 &lt;= 1 || 10 ==
2+8</tt> is true.<p>

The MOO also considers the following to be true:

</p><ul>
<li>any non-zero number</li>
<li>any non-empty list</li>
<li>any non-empty string</li>
</ul>

and the following to be false:

<ul>
<li>0</li>
<li>the empty list <tt>{}</tt></li>
<li>the empty string <tt>""</tt></li>
<li>object numbers</li>
</ul>


<p></p><h3>6.4) A Note on Lists</h3><p>

	Lists are very important to programming, and you will probably
want to use them a lot (unless you're a sheep.)  To refer to a single
element of a list, use the list's name followed by the index of the
element you want in square brackets:

</p><ul>
<li><tt>names[5]</tt> -- refers to the fifth element in the list "names"</li>
<li><tt>months[count+1]</tt> -- refers to the (count+1)th element of
"months"</li>
</ul>

You can also refer to a single letter in a string in this manner:

<ul>
<li><tt>hello_msg[5]</tt> -- fifth letter of the string variable
"hello_msg"</li>
<li><tt>#1.name[4]</tt> -- fourth letter of the name of the root object</li>
<li><tt>"Ulysses"[3]</tt> -- "y"</li>
</ul>

If you attempt to refer to an element of a list or a letter of a
string that does not exist (for instance, the list or string is not
that long) the MOO will give you an error message.  Similarly, if the
variable to which you are attaching an index reference is not a list
or a string, the MOO will get upset.<p>

<p></p><h2>7.0) Where To Go From Here</h2><p>
	
	Well, that's it folks!  From this point on, basic programming
is really just experimentation and logic.  If you write a verb and
upon trying to compile it in the Verb Editor are given some sort of
error message that contains <tt>Line #: syntax error</tt> (which will
almost certainly happen at some point), look over line # very
carefully, check that you have all the <tt>endifs</tt>,
<tt>endwhiles</tt>, <tt>endfors</tt> and semicolons that you need, and
then (in case of dire need) ask for help from a more experienced
programmer or a wizard.  The best way to learn is to play. :)</p><p>

interesting MOO code commands not mentioned here, or just general MOO
erudition, there are three other sources you might try.  The first is

<a name="html_tricks"></a>

</p><p></p><h2>A.0) More HereMOO-Specific HTML Tricks</h2><p>

There are a number of hip HTML-derived tricks that one can employ to
make HereMOO, as cool as it currently is, even cooler.</p><p>

<a name="link_command"></a>

</p><p></p><h3>A.1) Sending MOO Commands Via Links</h3><p>

On certain occasions, you may want a link to send a command to the
MOO.  For instance, a bouncy ball that has the verb <tt>bounce</tt> on
it might have the following description:</p><p>

</p><pre>	This shiny red ball makes you happy just looking 
	at it.  You could probably <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#bounce">bounce</a> it.
</pre>

<a name="bounce"></a>

Selecting the <tt>bounce</tt> link should have the same effect as
typing the command <tt>bounce ball</tt>.  So how do you do this?  Use
the <tt>?Command=</tt> syntax in the <tt>bounce</tt> link HREF.  Type
the following to give the ball its description including the
<tt>bounce</tt> link:<p>

</p><pre>@describe ball as "This shiny red ball makes you happy 
just looking at it.  You could probably 
&lt;A HREF="http://trickle.tripod.com/cgi/nph-moo?Command=bounce+ball"&gt;
bounce it." 
</pre>

Note first of all that the true URL of HereMOO is
<tt>http://trickle.tripod.com/cgi/nph-moo</tt>.  The <tt>bounce</tt>
link as formed above will ask for a new page from the MOO, but give it
the command <tt>bounce ball</tt> first.  The plus sign (<tt>+</tt>)
between "bounce" and "ball" is necessary to indicate where spaces
would be in a typed command, as URLs cannot contain spaces.<p>

As another example, let's say you have a Coke machine with the verb
<tt>buy</tt>; its syntax is <tt>buy <i>something</i> from
machine</tt>, where <i>something</i> has to be either <i>Sprite</i>,
<i>Coke</i> or <i>Dr. Pepper</i> (the drink of all true MOO
programmers.)  To give the Coke machine a description which allows
people to select their drink of choice just by selecting a link,
type:

</p><pre>
@describe coke machine as "It's big and rectangular, and you know what
it looks like.  You can buy &lt;A
HREF="http://trickle.tripod.com/cgi/nph-moo?Command=buy+sprite+from+machine"&gt;
a Sprite&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A
HREF="http://trickle.tripod.com/cgi/nph-moo?Command=buy+coke+from+machine"&gt;
a Coke&lt;/A&gt;, or &lt;A
HREF="http://trickle.tripod.com/cgi/nph-moo?Command=buy+dr.+pepper+from+machine&gt;a
Dr. Pepper&lt;/A&gt; (what the gods enjoy.)

</pre>

This looks pretty terrible to type in, but it's really just a set
of HTML tags interspersed with the text of the Coke machine's
description.  When people look at the Coke machine, they will see:

<pre>It's big and rectangular, and you know what it
looks like.  You can buy <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#drink">a Sprite</a>,
<a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#drink">a Coke</a>, or <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#manna">a Dr. Pepper</a> (what the gods enjoy.)
</pre>

<a name="drink"></a>
<a name="manna"></a>

By selecting the various drink names, people can buy a Sprite, Coke or
Dr.  Pepper (the One True Beverage) -- assuming you've programmed the
Coke machine's <tt>buy</tt> verb correctly!

<p></p><h3>A.2) Putting Your Own Images on the MOO</h3><p>

To truly personalize your MOO character, room and objects, you will
probably want to give them images you yourself have drawn and/or
scanned in.  You can, of course, put into your descriptions any image
anywhere on the World Wide Web: simply include an <tt>IMG</tt> tag in
your description that refers to the image's URL (see NCSA's <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html">Beginner's
Guide to HTML</a> on how to do this.)</p><p>

But if you have an image of your own that's not on the Web, the best
thing to do is to FTP it to your Tripod account -- check out Tripod's
<a href="http://www.tripod.com/planet/homepager/ext/ftp/">Anonymous
FTP Server FAQ</a> for help with this.  Once you've saved the image in
your account on Tripod, all you have to do is use the following HREF
in the <tt>IMG</tt> tag in your (or your room's, or your objects')
description:</p><p>

</p><pre>http://www.tripod.com/~<i>your_name</i>/<i>image_file_name</i></pre>

Remember that <i>your_name</i> is your username, not your real name.

<p></p><h3>A.3) Miscellany</h3><p>

For more information on how to structure command syntax, see the <a href="http://snowfall.tripod.com/Way_Easy_Guide.latest.html#programming">Programming Verbs</a> section.</p><p>

If you have questions about how to do other hip Web things on HereMOO,
don't hesitate to ask <a href="http://www.tripod.com/~Melanie">Melanie</a> or <a href="http://www.tripod.com/~Snowfall">Colin</a>.  Remember that all
HTML tags you include in descriptions will be interpreted; this means
that you can include graphics (and sound!) anywhere text is displayed
to MOO users.
