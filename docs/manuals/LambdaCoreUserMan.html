<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC1">Introduction</A></H1>

<P>
The LambdaCore database provides the facilities needed to make a
LambdaMOO server useful for Multi User Adventuring.  If you compare the
LambdaMOO server to a piece of computer hardware, then LambdaCore is the
operating system needed to allow the user to do useful work.


<P>
This document gives a rundown on the commands of the LambdaCore
database, providing examples of how they are used, and some of the ideas
behind them.  It does not cover how the commands work, nor how they are
implemented as verbs in the MOO programming language.  A companion
manual, <STRONG>The LambdaCore Programmer's Manual</STRONG> covers those aspects
of the LambdaCore database.


<P>
The user may find it useful to read the other companion manual to this
one, <EM>The LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual</EM>.  An understanding of MOO
concepts and the MOO language can be useful when playing the game.




<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC2">The LambdaCore Player Commands</A></H1>
<P>
A player interacts with the game using a large number of commands.  Most
of these commands are implemented within the database as verbs of object
classes.


<P>
The following sections list the commands in the LambdaCore database,
grouped roughly by function.  Some commands, such as those used for
manipulating notes, are defined by the particular class of object they
work on, in this case the <CODE>Note</CODE> class. Other commands are defined
for one or more classes.


<P>
This section intends to give a paper reference for the information given
in the <EM>help</EM> system within the LambdaCore database, with some
additional explanation of the concepts involved.


<P>
Note that, for commands that can be abbreviated, the form in which the
command is specified in the database is shown.  For example, the
<CODE>inventory</CODE> command is written down as



<PRE>
i*nventory
</PRE>

<P>
which means that this command can be invoked by the player typing any of
the following:



<PRE>
i
in
inv
inven
etc...
</PRE>



<H1><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC3">Commands That Affect Your Player</A></H1>

<P>
The <CODE>$player</CODE> class defines a number of verbs that allow the player
to change and view certain of his/her characteristics.  The following
commands are available :


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>help/information/?</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>help</B> <I><VAR>topic</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>help</B> <I><STRONG>index</STRONG></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>help</B> <I><VAR>object:verbname</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX4"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>help</B> <I>$<VAR>something</VAR>_utils</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX5"></A>


<P>
This command is used to print out entries from the online documentation
system.  The first form prints out a summary table of contents for the
entire help system.


<P>
The second form prints out the documentation available on the given
<VAR>topic</VAR>.  Many help system entries contain references to other
entries accessible in this way.  The topic name may be abbreviated in
either of two ways: you may give only a prefix of the complete topic
name (e.g., <SAMP>`bui'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`building'</SAMP>) and you may omit an
initial <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> character (e.g., <SAMP>`who'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`@who'</SAMP>).
If the abbreviation you give is ambiguous, you will be presented with a
list of the matching complete topic names.


<P>
The <SAMP>`help index'</SAMP> commands prints out a complete list of all help topic
names, arranged alphabetically.  It is sometimes easier to find the
topics you're interested in this way, rather than tracing through the
chain of cross references.


<P>
Finally, we have two addtional forms that are likely to be only of use 
to programmers:



<PRE>
help <VAR>object:verbname</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
This is used to print any documentation strings that are present at the
beginning of the program for that verb.



<PRE>
help $<VAR>foo_utils</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
prints general information about one of the <CODE>$..._utils</CODE> objects
(e.g., <CODE>$string_utils</CODE>, <CODE>$list_utils</CODE>, etc...), which are all
libraries of generally used verbs.


<P>
The commands <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`information'</SAMP> (usually abbreviated
<SAMP>`info'</SAMP>) are synonyms for <SAMP>`help'</SAMP>.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@quit</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX6"></A>
This command is used to disconnect from the MOO.  This breaks your
network connection and leaves your player sleeping.  Disconnecting in
most parts of the MOO automatically returns your player to its
designated home.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@gender</B> <I><VAR>gender</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@gender</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX8"></A>


<P>
The first form, with an argument, defines your player to have the gender
<VAR>gender</VAR>.  If <VAR>gender</VAR> is one of the standard genders (e.g.,
<SAMP>`male'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`female'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`neuter'</SAMP>,...), your various pronouns
will also be set appropriately, making exits and certain other objects
behave more pleasantly for you.


<P>
The second form tells you the current definition of your player's
gender, your current pronouns, and the complete list of standard
genders.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@password</B> <I><VAR>old-password</VAR> <VAR>new-password</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX9"></A>


<P>
Changes your player's password (as typed in the <SAMP>`connect'</SAMP> command
when you log in to the MOO) to <VAR>new-password</VAR>.  For security
reasons, you are required to type your current (soon to be old) password
as the first argument.


<P>
Your password is stored in an encrypted form in the MOO database; in
principle, not even the wizards can tell what it is, though they can
change it, of course.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@sethome</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX10"></A>


<P>
Sets your designated home (see <SAMP>`help home'</SAMP>) to be the room you're
in now.  If the current room wouldn't allow you to teleport in, then the
<SAMP>`@sethome'</SAMP> command nicely refuses to set your home there.  This
avoids later, perhaps unpleasant, surprises.
</DL>




<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC4">Exploring and Interacting With the Virtual World</A></H1>

<P>
The main purpose of the core classes in the LambdaCore database is to
allow players to construct and explore a virtual world.  This involves
moving from one room to another, using designated pathways or
<EM>exits</EM> and looking at objects and locations along the way.  The
command given in this section are used for exploring the virtual world,
and interacting with the game administrators, using <CODE>news</CODE> and
<CODE>@gripe</CODE>.  These verbs are defined by a variety of different
classes. 




<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC5">Movement</A></H2>
<P>
The descriptions of most rooms outline the directions in which exits
exist.  Typical directions include the eight compass points
(<SAMP>`north'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`south'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`east'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`west'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`northeast'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`southeast'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`northwest'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`southwest'</SAMP>), <SAMP>`up'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`down'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`out'</SAMP>.


<P>
To go in a particular direction, simply type the name of that direction
(e.g, <SAMP>`north'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`up'</SAMP>).  The name of the direction can usually
be abbreviated to one or two characters (e.g., <SAMP>`n'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`sw'</SAMP>).
You can also type <SAMP>`go <VAR>direction</VAR>'</SAMP> to move; this is
particularly useful if you know you're going to type several movement
commands in a row.


<P>
In addition to such vanilla movement, some areas may contain objects
allowing teleportation and almost all areas permit the use of the
<SAMP>`home'</SAMP> command to teleport you to your designated home.


<P>
A couple of other commands are available to allow movement from one
place to another.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>go</B> <I><VAR>direction</VAR> ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX11"></A>


<P>
Invokes the named exits in the named order, moving through many rooms in
a single command.



<PRE>
blip types:
&#62; go n e e u e e s e
</PRE>

<P>
and moves quite rapidly north, east, east, up, east, east south and
east, all in one command.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>home</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX12"></A>


<P>
Instantly teleports you to your designated home room.  Initially, this
room is the <CODE>$player_start</CODE> room.  You can change your designated
home using the <VAR>@sethome</VAR> command.
</DL>




<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC6">Commands for Manipulating Objects</A></H2>
<P>
Objects usually have verbs defined on them that allow players to
manipulate and use them in various ways. Standard ones are:



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>get</CODE>
<DD>
- pick an object up and place it in your inventory
<DT><CODE>drop</CODE>
<DD>
- remove an object from your inventory and place it in the room
<DT><CODE>put</CODE>
<DD>
- take an object from your inventory and place it in a container
<DT><CODE>give</CODE>
<DD>
- hand an object to some other player
<DT><CODE>look</CODE>
<DD>
- see what an object looks like
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
You can see what objects you're carrying with the <SAMP>`inventory'</SAMP> command.


<P>
Some specialized objects will have other commands. The programmer of the
object will usually provide some way for you to find out what the
commands are.  One way that works for most objects is the <SAMP>`examine'</SAMP>
command.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>inventory</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX13"></A>
Prints a list showing every object you're carrying.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>take</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>get</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>take</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> from <VAR>container</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>get</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> from <VAR>container</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>remove</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> from <VAR>container</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX18"></A>


<P>
The first two forms pick up the named object and place it in your
inventory.  Sometimes the owner of the object won't allow it to be
picked up for some reason.


<P>
The remaining forms move the named object from inside the named
container into your inventory.  As before, sometimes the owner of an
object will not allow you to do this.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>drop</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>throw</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX20"></A>
Remove an object you are carrying from your inventory and put it in your
current room.  Occasionally you may find that the owner of the room
won't allow you to do this.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>put</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> <STRONG>into</STRONG> <VAR>container</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>insert</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> <STRONG>in</STRONG> <VAR>container</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX22"></A>
Moves the named object into the named container.  Sometimes the owners
of the object and/or the container will not allow you to do this.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>give</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> <STRONG>to</STRONG> <VAR>player</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>hand</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> <STRONG>to</STRONG> <VAR>player</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX24"></A>
Move an object from your contents to that of another player.  This
doesn't change the ownership of the object.  Some players may refuse to
accept gifts and some objects may refuse to be given.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>look</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>look</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>look</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> <STRONG>in</STRONG> <VAR>container</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX27"></A>
This command is used to show a description of something.  The first
form, with no arguments, shows you the name and description of the room
you're in, along with a list of the other objects that are there.


<P>
The second form lets you look at a specific object.  Most objects have
descriptions that may be read this way.  You can look at your own
description using <SAMP>`look me'</SAMP>.  You can set the description for an
object or room, including yourself, with the <SAMP>`describe'</SAMP> command.


<P>
The third form shows you the description of an object that is inside
some other object, including objects being carried by another player.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>examine</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>exam</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX29"></A>


<P>
Prints several useful pieces of information about the named object,
including the following:



<UL>
<LI>

its full name, aliases, and object number
<LI>

its owner's name and object number
<LI>

its description
<LI>

its key expression (if it is locked and if you own it)
<LI>

its contents and their object numbers
<LI>

the <EM>obvious</EM> verbs defined on it
</UL>

<P>
The <EM>obvious</EM> verbs are those that are readable and that can be
invoked as commands.  To keep a verb off this list, either make it
unreadable using <SAMP>`@chmod'</SAMP>or, if it shouldn't be used as a
command, give it <CODE>args</CODE> of <SAMP>`this none this'</SAMP>.
</DL>




<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC7">Interacting With Other Players</A></H1>

<P>
There are several commands available to allow you to communicate with
your fellow players.  Other commands are available to affect the way
communication occurs.  The following list shows the commands used for
these functions:



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>say</CODE>
<DD>
- talking to the other connected players in the room
<DT><CODE>whisper</CODE>
<DD>
- talking privately to someone in the same room
<DT><CODE>page</CODE>
<DD>
- yelling to someone anywhere in the MOO
<DT><CODE>emote</CODE>
<DD>
- non-verbal communication with others in the same room
<DT><CODE>@gag, @listgag, @ungag</CODE>
<DD>
- screening out noise generated by certain other players
<DT><CODE>news</CODE>
<DD>
- reading the wizards' most recent set of general announcements
<DT><CODE>@gripe</CODE>
<DD>
- sending complaints to the wizards
<DT><CODE>@typo @bug @idea @suggest</CODE>
<DD>
- sending complaints/ideas to the owner of the current room
<DT><CODE>whereis</CODE>
<DD>
- locating other players
<DT><CODE>@who</CODE>
<DD>
- finding out who is currently logged in
<DT><CODE>mail</CODE>
<DD>
- the MOO email system
<DT><CODE>@paranoid, @check, @sweep</CODE>
<DD>
- the facilities for detecting forged messages and eavesdropping.
</DL>
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC8">Communicating With Other Players</A></H2>

<P>
Several commands are available for communicating with other players in
the way you might do in real life.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>say</B> <I><VAR>anything</VAR> ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>"<VAR>anything</VAR></B> <I>...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX31"></A>


<P>
Says <VAR>anything</VAR> out loud, so that everyone in the same room hears
it.  This is so commonly used that there's a special abbreviation for
it: any command-line beginning with a double-quote (<SAMP>`"'</SAMP>) is treated
as a <SAMP>`say'</SAMP> command.


<P>
For example, suppose that blip types the following command:

<PRE>
"This is a great MOO!
</PRE>

<P>
He would see this printed on his terminal screen:



<PRE>
You say, "This is a great MOO!"
</PRE>

<P>
Others in the same room see this:



<PRE>
blip says, "This is a great MOO!"
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>whisper</B> <I>"<VAR>text</VAR>" to <VAR>player</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX32"></A>
This command sends the message "<VAR>yourname</VAR> whispers, "<VAR>text</VAR>" to
you " to <VAR>player</VAR>, if they are in the room.  This is used to send a
private message to a another player in the room. The message is passed
to <VAR>player</VAR> only.  No-one else can hear or detect the message.  For
example, the command



<PRE>
whisper "Hello there" to blip
</PRE>

<P>
sends the following message to blip:



<PRE>
Ezeke whispers, "hello there" to blip.
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>page</B> <I><VAR>player</VAR> [[with] <VAR>text</VAR>]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX33"></A>
This verb is a player command used to send messages between players who
are not physically located in the same room in the virtual world.  You
can imagine a <EM>page</EM> to be a worldwide form of shouting.  Without an
argument, a message like



<PRE>
You sense that blip is looking for you in The Venue Hallway.
</PRE>

<P>
is sent to the recipient of the page.  If an argument is given, it is
treated as a message to send to the other player.  This results in the
recipient getting a message like



<PRE>
You sense that blip is looking for you in The Hallway
He pages, "Hello - are you busy ?"
</PRE>

<P>
Paging is used primarily to attract the attention of a player, or to
pass short messages between players in different locations.  It is not
intended to be used for conversation.
</DL>


<P>
The following commands can be used to set messages referred to by
<SAMP>`@page'</SAMP>:


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@page_origin</B> <I><VAR>message</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX34"></A>
The <EM>page origin</EM> message determines how the recipient is told of
your location.  The default value of this message is <SAMP>`You sense
that %n is looking for you in %l.'</SAMP>
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@page_echo</B> <I><VAR>message</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX35"></A>
The <EM>page echo</EM> message determines the response received by anyone
who pages you.  The default value of this message is <SAMP>`Your message
has been sent.'</SAMP>
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@page_absent</B> <I><VAR>message</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX36"></A>
This message determines the response received by anyone who tries to
page you when you aren't connected. The default value of this message is
<SAMP>`%n is not currently logged in.'</SAMP>
</DL>


<P>
All of these undergo the usual pronoun substitutions except that in both
cases the direct object <SAMP>`%d'</SAMP> refers to the recipent of the page and
the indirect object <SAMP>`%i'</SAMP> refers to the sender.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>emote</B> <I><VAR>anything</VAR> ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>:<VAR>anything</VAR></B> <I>...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX38"></A>


<P>
Announces <VAR>anything</VAR> to everyone in the same room, prepending your
name.  This is commonly used to express various non-verbal forms of
communication.  In fact, it is so commonly used that there's a special
abbreviation for it: any command-line beginning with <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> is treated
as an <SAMP>`emote'</SAMP> command.


<P>
For example, if blip types the following:

<PRE>
:wishes he were much taller...
</PRE>

<P>
Everyone in the same room would see the following message:

<PRE>
blip wishes he were much taller...
</PRE>

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC9">Gagging - How to Ignore Other Players and Objects</A></H2>

<P>
Occasionally, you may run into a situation in which you'd rather not
hear from certain other players.  It might be that they're being
annoying, or just that whatever they're doing makes a lot of noise.
Gagging a player will stop you from hearing the results of any task
initiated by that player.  You can also gag a specific object, if you
want to hear what the owner of that object says, but not the output from
their noisy robot.  The commands to use gagging are described below:


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@gag</B> <I><VAR>player or object</VAR> [<VAR>player or object</VAR>...]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX39"></A>
Add the given players to your <EM>gag list</EM>.  You will no longer see any
messages that result from actions initiated by these players.  In
particular, you will not hear them if they try to speak, emote, or
whisper to you.


<P>
For example, if blip types in the following command:

<PRE>
@gag geezer
</PRE>

<P>
and no longer hears anything that geezer says. <A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>


<P>
If you specify an object, then any text originating from that object
will not be printed.


<P>
For example, suppose <CODE>Noisy Robot</CODE> prints <SAMP>`Hi there'</SAMP> every 15
seconds.  In order to avoid seeing that, blip types the following
command:



<PRE>
@gag Noisy
</PRE>

<P>
and no longer hears that robot!  Note that blip must be in the same room
as <CODE>Noisy Robot</CODE> for this to work, or know its object number.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@ungag</B> <I><VAR>player or object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@ungag</B> <I><STRONG>everyone</STRONG></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX41"></A>


<P>
Remove the given player or object (or, in the second form,
<STRONG>everyone</STRONG>) from your <SAMP>`gag list'</SAMP>.  You will once again see
any messages that result from actions initiated by the ungagged
player(s) or objects.  In particular, you will once again be able to
hear them if they speak, emote, or whisper to you.


<P>
For example, suppose that blip types the following:

<PRE>
@ungag geezer
</PRE>

<P>
and is once again able to hear geezer's witty remarks.  <A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@listgag</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX42"></A>


<P>
Shows you a list of the players and objects currently on your <EM>gag
list</EM>.  You don't see any messages that result from actions initiated by
the players or objects on this list.  In particular, you will not hear

<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC10">Communicating With The Game Administrators</A></H2>

<P>
Several commands are provided for communicating with the people that run
the game.  The <CODE>news</CODE> command is used by the wizards to let players
know of anything that is globally interesting.  Players can use
<SAMP>`@grip'</SAMP> to complain to the wizards, and commands like
<SAMP>`@typo'</SAMP> to report defects to builders and programmers.


<P>
The following section describes these commands in detail.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>news</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX43"></A>
Read the latest edition of the LambdaMOO server news, which carries
articles concerning recent changes to the MOO server or to the main
public classes, or whatever else is important for players to know.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@gripe</B> <I><VAR>anything</VAR> ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX44"></A>
Puts you into the MOO mail system to register a complaint (or,
conceivably, a compliment) with the wizards.  The rest of the command
line (the <VAR>anything</VAR> ... part) is used as the subject line for
the message.  More information on using the MOO mail system is given
once you're in it.


<P>
You may hear back from the wizards eventually.  For example:



<PRE>
&#62;@gripe The Fruitbat
&#62;"How come I can't ever see the fruitbat in the Venue Clock?
&#62;"        -- A frustrated player
</PRE>

<P>
sends it, and, somewhat later, the wizards reply with a note about being
sure to look while the Clock is chiming.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@typo</B> <I>[<VAR>text</VAR>]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX45"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@suggest</B> <I>[<VAR>text</VAR>]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@bug</B> <I>[<VAR>text</VAR>]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX47"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@idea</B> <I>[<VAR>text</VAR>]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX48"></A>


<P>
If <VAR>text</VAR> is given, a one-line message is sent to the owner of the
room, presumably about something that you've noticed.  If <VAR>text</VAR> is
not given, we assume you have more to say than can fit comfortably on a
single line; the usual mail editor is invoked.  The convention is that
@typo is for typographical errors on the room or objects found therein,
@bug is for anomalous or nonintuitive behaviour of some sort, and
@idea/@suggest for anything else.


<P>
The usual mail editor is only invoked for this command when in rooms
that allow free entry, i.e., rooms that are likely to allow you back
after you are done editing your message.  Otherwise these commands will
require <VAR>text</VAR> and only let you do one-line messages.  Most
adventuring scenario rooms fall into this latter category.
</DL>




<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC11">Locating Other Players in the Virtual World</A></H2>

<P>
Two commands are available for finding out where other players are
hiding in the virtual world, as follows:


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>whereis</B> <I><VAR>player</VAR> [<VAR>player</VAR>...]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX49"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@whereis</B> <I><VAR>player</VAR> [<VAR>player</VAR>...]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX50"></A>
Returns the current location of each of the specified players.  whereis
refers to each player's <SAMP>`@whereis_location'</SAMP> message to determine
what should be printed.  This message defaults to



<PRE>
"%N (%#) is in %l (%[#l])." 
</PRE>

<P>
and the usual pronoun substitutions are done.


<P>
For example the default message could expand to



<PRE>
"blip (#42) is in The Venue Manager's Office (#47)
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@who</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@who</B> <I><VAR>player</VAR> [<VAR>player</VAR> ...]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX52"></A>
The first form lists all of the currently-connected players, along with
the amount of time they've been connected, the amount of time they've
been idle, and their present location in the MOO.


<P>
The second form, in which a list of player names is given, shows
information for just those players.  For any listed players that are not
connected, we show the last login time instead of the connect/idle
times.


<P>
<SAMP>`@who'</SAMP> refers to the <SAMP>`@who_location'</SAMP> on each of the players
to be listed in order to determine what should be printed in the
location column.  Pronoun substitutions are done on this string in the
usual manner.  The default value is "%l" (i.e., <CODE>player.location</CODE>).
</DL>




<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC12">Checking the Security of Your Communication</A></H2>
<P>
There are several commands available that allow you to check that your
communications with other players are secure.  The following commands
are available:


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@sweep</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX53"></A>
Used when you wish to have a private conversation, and are concerned
someone may be listening in. <CODE>@sweep</CODE> tries to list the avenues by which
information may be leaving the room. In a manner analogous to @check,
it assumes that you don't want to hear about your own verbs, or those
belonging to wizards, who presumably wouldn't stoop to bugging.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@paranoid</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@paranoid</B> <I><STRONG>off</STRONG></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@paranoid</B> <I><STRONG>immediate</STRONG></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@paranoid</B> <I><VAR>number</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX57"></A>


<P>
In immediate mode, the monitor prepends everything you hear with the
name of the character it considers responsible for the message.
Otherwise, it keeps records of the last <VAR>number</VAR> (defaults to 20)
lines you have heard. These records can be accessed by the @check
command.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@check</B> <I><VAR>options</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX58"></A>
Used when you are suspicious about the origin of some of the messages
your character has just heard.  Various <VAR>options</VAR> can be specified:



<UL>
<LI>

the number of lines to be displayed 
<LI>

a player's name, someone to be "trusted" during the assignment of
responsibility for the message.
<LI>a player's named prefixed by !, someone not to be "trusted".

</UL>

<P>
Output from @check is in columns that contain, in order, the monitor's
best guess as to:

<UL>
<LI>

what object the message came from,
<LI>

what verb on that object that was responsible,
<LI>

whose permissions that verb was running with, and the beginning of the
actual message.
</UL>

<P>
<SAMP>`@check'</SAMP> operates by examining the list of verbs that were
involved in delivering the message, and assigning responsibility to the
first owner it sees who is not <EM>trusted</EM>.  By default, it trusts you
and all the wizards.  It uses the records maintained by
<SAMP>`@paranoid'</SAMP>, so you must have used that command before you
received the message.
</DL>




<H1><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC13">Using Pronoun Substitutions</A></H1>
<P>
Some kinds of messages are not printed directly to players; they are
allowed to contain special characters marking places to include the
appropriate pronoun for some player.  For example, a builder might have
a doorway that's very short, so that people have to crawl to get through
it.  When they do so, the builder wants a little message like this to be
printed:



<PRE>
Zaphod crawls through the little doorway, bruising his knee.
</PRE>

<P>
The problem is the use of <SAMP>`his'</SAMP> in the message; what if the player
in question is female?  The correct setting of the <SAMP>`oleave'</SAMP> message
on that doorway is as follows:



<PRE>
crawls through the little doorway, bruising %p knee.
</PRE>

<P>
The <SAMP>`%p'</SAMP> in the message will be replaced by either <SAMP>`his'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`her'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`its'</SAMP>, depending upon the gender of the player.


<P>
As it happens, you can also refer to elements of the command line (e.g.,
direct and indirect objects) the object issuing the message, and the
location where this is all happening.  In addition one can refer to
arbitrary string properties on these objects, or get the object numbers
themselves.


<P>
The complete set of substitutions is as follows:



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>%%</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; `%'  (just in case you actually want to talk about percentages).
<DT><CODE>%n</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; the player
<DT><CODE>%t</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; this object (i.e., the object issuing the message,... usually)
<DT><CODE>%d</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; the direct object from the command line
<DT><CODE>%i</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; the indirect object from the command line
<DT><CODE>%l</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; the location of the player
<DT><CODE>%s</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; subject pronoun:          either <SAMP>`he'</SAMP>,  <SAMP>`she'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`it'</SAMP>
<DT><CODE>%o</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; object pronoun:           either <SAMP>`him'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`her'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`it'</SAMP>
<DT><CODE>%p</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; posessive pronoun (adj):  either <SAMP>`his'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`her'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`its'</SAMP>  
<DT><CODE>%q</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; posessive pronoun (noun): either <SAMP>`his'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`hers'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`its'</SAMP>
<DT><CODE>%r</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; reflexive pronoun:  either <SAMP>`himself'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`herself'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`itself'</SAMP>
<DT><CODE>%(foo)</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; player.foo 
<DT><CODE>%[tfoo], %[dfoo], %[ifoo], %[lfoo]</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; this.foo, dobj.foo, iobj.foo, and player.location.foo
<DT><CODE>%#</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; player's object number
<DT><CODE>%[#t], %[#d], %[#i], %[#l]</CODE>
<DD>
=&#62; object numbers for this, direct obj, indirect obj, and location.
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
In addition there is a set of capitalized substitutions for use at the
beginning of sentences.  These are, respectively,



<UL>
<LI>

%N, %T, %D, %I, %L for object names, 
<LI>

%S, %O, %P, %Q, %R for pronouns, and
<LI>

%(Foo), %[dFoo] (== %[Dfoo] == %[DFoo]),... for general properties
</UL>

<P>
Note that there is a special exception for player name's (the
<CODE>.name</CODE> propertywhich are assumed to already be capitalized as
desired.


<P>
There may be situations where the standard algorithm, i.e., upcasing the
first letter, yields something incorrect, in which case a
<EM>capitalization</EM> for a particular string property can be specified
explicitly.  If your object has a <CODE>.foo</CODE> property that is like
this, you need merely add a <CODE>.fooc</CODE> (in general
<CODE>.(<VAR>propertyname</VAR>+"c")</CODE>) specifying the correct capitalization.
This will also work for player <CODE>.name</CODE>'s if you want to specify a
capitalization that is different from your usual .<CODE>name</CODE>


<P>
For example, Phantom makes a hand-grenade with a customizable explode
message.  Suppose someone sets <CODE>grenade.explode_msg</CODE> to:



<PRE>
"%N(%#) drops %t on %p foot.  %T explodes.  
%L is engulfed in flames."
</PRE>

<P>
If the current location happens to be #1234("blip's house"),
the resulting substitution may produce, eg.,



<PRE>
Phantom(#42) drops grenade on his foot.  Grenade explodes.  
Blip's house is engulfed in flames.
</PRE>

<P>
which contains an incorrect capitalization (The name <SAMP>`blip'</SAMP> cannot
be capitalized.  blip may remedy this by setting



<PRE>
#1234.namec="blip's house".
</PRE>

<P>


<P>
A special nore for programmers: in programs, use
<CODE>$string_utils:pronoun_sub()</CODE>.  Using the substitution <CODE>%n</CODE>
actually calls <CODE>player:title()</CODE> while <CODE>%(name)</CODE> refers to
<CODE>player.name</CODE> directly.




<H1><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC14">The MOO Mail System</A></H1>
<P>
The MOO email system allows you to send and receive messages to and from
other players.  Whilst not approaching the complexity of a fully fledged
email system, it does allow players to send short messages between
themselves, normally on game related topics.  The <CODE>Mail Room</CODE> class
defines a set of verbs that can be used by other MOO programs to send
mail.  This is used, for example, by the <CODE>@gripe</CODE> command, which
uses the MOO Mail system to deliver gripes to the game administrators.


<P>
The following commands are used to activate portions of the MOO mail
system:



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>@mail</CODE>
<DD>
- seeing a table of contents for your collection of email messages
<DT><CODE>@read</CODE>
<DD>
- reading individual messages in your collection

<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@mail</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX59"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@mail</B> <I>new</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX60"></A>


<P>
Shows a table of contents for your MOO email message collection.  You
are notified when you connect to the MOO if there are any such messages.
A little arrow indicates the mail system's notion of your <EM>current
message</EM>.  The first form lists all of your messages; the second form
lists all messages after your <EM>current message</EM>.


<P>
If you have a large number of mail messages, you can give arguments so
that @mail only lists the messages you're interested in.  The general
format is



<PRE>
@mail <VAR>message-sequence</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>message-sequence</VAR> is some combination of the following



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>cur</CODE>
<DD>

<DT><CODE>new</CODE>
<DD>

<DD><A NAME="IDX61"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@read</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX62"></A>


<P>
Prints the contents of the indicated messages from your MOO email
collection.  You get the message numbers for use here by typing the
<SAMP>`@mail'</SAMP> command, which prints a table of contents for your entire MOO
email collection.  If no arguments are given to <SAMP>`@read'</SAMP>, then the
<EM>current message</EM> in your collection is printed.  In any case, the
<EM>current message</EM> after <SAMP>`@read'</SAMP> finishes is the last one printed.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@next</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX63"></A>
Print the <SAMP>`next'</SAMP> message in your MOO email collection.  The mail
system's notion of your <EM>current message</EM> is incremented.  Thus, one
can read all of one's new messages one-by-one simply by typing <SAMP>`@next'</SAMP>
repeatedly.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@prev</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX64"></A>
Print the <SAMP>`previous'</SAMP> message in your MOO email collection.  The
mail system's notion of your <EM>current message</EM> is decremented.  Thus,
one can review all of one's previous messages one-by-one simply by
typing <SAMP>`@prev'</SAMP> repeatedly.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@send</B> <I><VAR>recipient</VAR> [<VAR>recipient</VAR> ...]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX65"></A>
Prepares for you to compose a MOO email message to the recipients named
on the command line.  A recipient can be specified by giving a player
name or object-id, or a <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> followed by the name or object-id of
some non-player mail recipient (e.g., a mailing list or a mail folder).
A list of such non-player recipients is available from within the
mailroom with the <SAMP>`showlists'</SAMP> command.


<P>
When the <SAMP>`@send'</SAMP> command is typed, the usual line editor is
invoked.  The <SAMP>`subject'</SAMP> command is used to set a <CODE>Subject:</CODE>
line.  Use <SAMP>`say'</SAMP> (<SAMP>`"'</SAMP>) to insert lines in the body of your
message.


<P>
Giving this command without arguments resumes editing the previous
unsent draft message if one exists.

<DD><A NAME="IDX67"></A>


<P>
Prepares for you to compose a MOO email message to the players who
either received or composed the indicated message from your collection.
The usual editor is invoked.  The subject line for the new message will
be initialized from that of the indicated message.  If you leave off the
message number, the reply will be to your current message, if that
exists.


<P>
If there is a <CODE>Reply-to:</CODE> field in the message you are answering,
its contents will be used to initialize the <CODE>To:</CODE> line of your
reply.  Otherwise, a <CODE>To:</CODE> line is determined depending on whether
you specified <SAMP>`sender'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`all'</SAMP> in the command line (or your
<CODE>.mail_options</CODE>).


<P>
<SAMP>`incl'</SAMP> includes the text of the original message in your reply,
<SAMP>`noincl'</SAMP> does not.


<P>
Defaults are <SAMP>`sender'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`noincl'</SAMP>, but you can change this by
setting your <CODE>.mail-options</CODE> property.

<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@rmmail</B> <I><VAR>message-number</VAR> <VAR>message-number</VAR> ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX68"></A>
Deletes the indicated messages from your MOO email collection.  There is
no confirmation for this action, so be careful; deleted messages are
really gone, irrecoverable.  You get the message numbers for use here by
typing the <SAMP>`@mail'</SAMP> command, which prints a table of contents for your
entire MOO email collection.


<P>
You may specify <STRONG>cur</STRONG> in place of a number to specify your current

<H2><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC15">Mail Options</A></H2>
<P>
There are 3 personal properties that you can use to customize how your
mail is composed and forwarded




<H3><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC16">.mail_forward</A></H3>
<P>
This property is a list of people (object reference numbers) who will
receive any mail that gets sent to you.  This list may include
non-person recipients (i.e.,descendants of <CODE>$mail_recipient</CODE>).  If
this list is nonempty, you will not receive any mail yourself unless you
are on it.  E.g., if blip is #42 and ur-blip is #43



<PRE>
#43.mail_forward={}         -- usual case; ur-blip gets his own mail.
#43.mail_forward={#42}      -- blip gets ur-blip's mail instead.
#43.mail_forward={#43,#42}  -- ur-blip gets mail and blip gets a copy.

</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC17">.mail_notify</A></H3>
<P>
This property is a list of people (object reference numbers) to be
notified whenever mail is sent to you.  This list may include anything
that has a <CODE>:tell()</CODE> verb.  Notification will take place regardless
of whether or how your mail is forwarded.  Thus, in the previous example



<PRE>
#42.mail_notify={#43}
</PRE>

<P>
means that ur-blip will be told whenever blip is sent new mail.




<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC18">.mail_options</A></H3>
<P>
This property is a list of options that is consulted by @send and
@answer to determine how messages should initially be composed


<P>
The following options are available for @answer:

<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>sender</CODE>
<DD>
-  replies go only to the message's author (<CODE>From:</CODE> line).
<DT><CODE>all</CODE>
<DD>
- replies go to everyone who got the original (<CODE>From:</CODE> + <CODE>To:</CODE>
lines)
<DT><CODE>incl</CODE>
<DD>
-  include original message in the body of your reply.
<DT><CODE>noincl</CODE>
<DD>
-  don't include original message in the body of your reply.

</PRE>

<P>
The following option affects the behaviour of @send and @answer:

<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>replyto</CODE>
<DD>
="<VAR>list of people</VAR>". A <CODE>Reply-to:</CODE> field will be added containing these people.
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
So, for example, if ur-blip usually wants his replies to go to everyone

do

<PRE>
;#43.mail_options = {"all", "incl"};
</PRE>



<H1><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC19">Building and Creating Objects</A></H1>
<P>
There are a number of commands available to players for building new
parts of the MOO.  The primary means for players to extend the MOO is
for them to create new objects with interesting behavior.  There are
convenient commands for creating and recycling objects and for keeping
track of the objects you've created.


<P>
The following commands are used in the creation of objects:



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>@dig</CODE>
<DD>
- conveniently building new rooms and exits
<DT><CODE>@create</CODE>
<DD>
- making other kinds of objects
<DT><CODE>@recycle</CODE>
<DD>
- destroying objects you no longer want
<DT><CODE>@quota</CODE>
<DD>
- determining how many more objects you can build
<DT><CODE>@count</CODE>
<DD>
- determining how many objects you already own
<DT><CODE>@audit</CODE>
<DD>
- listing all of your objects
<DT><CODE>@classes</CODE>
<DD>
- listing all of the public classes available for your use
<DT><CODE>@move</CODE>
<DD>
- moving your objects from place to place
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
They are described in detail in the following paragraphs.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@create</B> <I><VAR>class-name</VAR> named "<VAR>names</VAR>"</I>

<DD><A NAME="IDX71"></A>


<P>
The main command for creating objects other than rooms and exits, for
which <SAMP>`@dig'</SAMP> is more convenient.


<P>
The first argument specifies the <EM>parent</EM> of the new object: loosely
speaking, the <EM>kind</EM> of object you're creating.  <VAR>class-name</VAR> is
one of the four standard classes of objects: 



<UL>
<LI>

<P>
  As time goes on, more <EM>standard classes</EM> may be added.  If the parent
you have in mind for your new object isn't one of these, you may use the
parent's name (if it's in the same room as you) or else its object
number (e.g., #1234).


<P>
The <VAR>names</VAR> are given in the same format as in the <SAMP>`@rename'</SAMP>
command, as follows:



<PRE>
<VAR>name</VAR>:<VAR>alias</VAR>,...,<VAR>alias</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
or alternatively



<PRE>
<VAR>name-and-alias</VAR>,<VAR>alias</VAR>,...,<VAR>alias</VAR>

<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@describe</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> <STRONG>as</STRONG> <VAR>description</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX72"></A>
Sets the description string of <VAR>object</VAR> to <VAR>description</VAR>.  This
is the string that is printed out whenever someone uses the <SAMP>`look'</SAMP>
command on <VAR>object</VAR>.  To describe yourself, use <SAMP>`me'</SAMP> as the
<VAR>object</VAR>.


<P>
For example, if blip types the following:

<PRE>
@describe me as "A very fine fellow, if a bit on the short side."
</PRE>

<P>
People who type <SAMP>`look blip'</SAMP> now see this:



<PRE>
A very fine fellow, if a bit on the short side.
</PRE>

<P>
The description of an object is kept in its <CODE>.description</CODE>
property.  For multi-line descriptions, <CODE>.description</CODE> can be a
list of strings.

<DD><A NAME="IDX75"></A>
The first two forms are used to change the name and aliases of an
object.  The name is what will be used in most printed descriptions of
the object.  The aliases are the names by which players can refer to the
object in commands.  NOTE that the name of a player may not include
spaces and that no two players may have the same name at the same time.


<P>
For example, if blip names his dog using the following command:



<PRE>
@rename #4237 to "Rover the Wonder Dog":Rover,dog
</PRE>

<P>
Now we'll see <SAMP>`Rover the Wonder Dog'</SAMP> if we're in the same room as
him and we can refer to him as either <SAMP>`Rover'</SAMP> or just <SAMP>`dog'</SAMP> in
our commands, like <SAMP>`pet dog'</SAMP>.


<P>
The third form of the @rename command is for use by programmers, to
change the name of a verb they own.  If the <VAR>new-verb-name</VAR> contains
spaces, the verb will have multiple names, one for each space-separated
word.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@recycle</B> <I><VAR>object-name-or-number</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX76"></A>
Destroys the indicated object utterly and irretrievably.  Naturally, you
may only do this to objects that you own.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@quota</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX77"></A>
Each player has a limit as to how many objects that player may create,
called their <EM>quota</EM>.  Every object they create lowers the quota by one
and every object they recycle increases it by one.  If the quota goes to
zero, then that player may not create any more objects (unless, of
course, they recycle some first).


<P>
The <SAMP>`@quota'</SAMP> command prints out your current quota.


<P>
To get a larger quota, talk to a wizard.  They will take a look at what
you've done with the objects you've built so far and make a
determination about whether or not it would be a net gain for the MOO
community if you were to build some more things.  If so, they will
increase your quota; if not, they will try to explain some ways in which
you could build things that were more useful, entertaining, or otherwise
interesting to other players.


<P>
The quota mechanism is intended to solve a long-standing problem in many
MUDs: database bloat.  The problem is that a large number of people
build a large number of dull objects and areas that are subsequently
never used or visited.  The database becomes quite large and difficult
to manage without getting substantially more interesting.  With the
quota system, we can make it possible for players to experiment and
learn while simultaneously keeping random building to acceptable levels.


<P>
It is expected that some will find the quota system distasteful or
otherwise controversial.  It was invented by Haakon and he is always
interested in hearing your constructive comments, suggestions and
protests.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@count</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX78"></A>
Prints out the number of objects you own.  Do not be surprised if this
is one larger than you think it should be: remember that your player
object is owned by you as well, even though you didn't create it in the
usual way.
</DL>

<DD><A NAME="IDX80"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@audit</B> <I><VAR>player</VAR> from <VAR>number</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX81"></A>
The first form prints out a list of every object you own, giving each
one's name and object number.


<P>
The second form does the same for the named player.


<P>
The third form does the same for the named player, but begins searching
the database with the numbered object.  <VAR>player</VAR> may be replaced by
"me" to restrict the audit of yourself.  This can be useful if you know
the player does not own any objects below a certain number (typically
the player's number itself).


<P>
Interestingly, due to a quirk of the code, "@audit me from me" will
show you objects owned by you starting with your object number, an
unexpected shorthand.
</DL>

<DD><A NAME="IDX82"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@classes</B> <I><VAR>class-name</VAR> ...</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX83"></A>
The wizards have identified several useful classes of objects in the
database.  The <SAMP>`@classes'</SAMP> command is used to see which classes
exist and what their member objects are.


<P>
The first form simply lists all of the defined classes along with short
descriptions of the membership of each.


<P>
The second form prints an indented listing of that subset of the object
parent/child hierarchy containing the objects in the class(es) you
specify.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@move</B> <I><VAR>thing</VAR> to <VAR>place</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX84"></A>
Move the specified object to the specified location.  This is not
guaranteed to work; in particular, the object must agree to be moved and
the destination must agree to allow the object in.  This is usually the
case, however.  The special case where <VAR>thing</VAR> is <SAMP>`me'</SAMP> is
useful for teleporting yourself around.


<P>
If @move doesn't work and you own the room where the object is located,
try using <SAMP>`@eject'</SAMP> instead.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@eject</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@eject</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> from <VAR>place</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX86"></A>


<P>
This command is used to remove unwanted objects from places you own.
Players thus removed are unceremoniously dumped in the default player
starting place.  Other kinds of objects get thrown into <CODE>#-1</CODE> or
<CODE>$nothing</CODE>.  Unlike <SAMP>`@move'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`@eject'</SAMP> does <EM>not</EM>
check to see if the object wants to be moved, and with the destination
being what it is, there is no question of the destination refusing the
move, either.  Generally, you should only resort to <SAMP>`@eject'</SAMP> if
<SAMP>`@move'</SAMP> doesn't work.


<P>
The first form of the command removes the object from the current room.
The second form removes the object from the specified place (which, in
most cases, you'll have to specify as an object number).  In either
case, this command only works if you own the room/entity from which the
object is being ejected.


<P>
The form of the command



<PRE>
@eject ... from me
</PRE>

<P>
suffices to get rid of some unwanted object in your inventory.
</DL>


<P>
On any given room, one may user the following commands to set the
messages used for ejection:


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@ejection</B> <I><VAR>message</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX87"></A>
This message is Printed to player issuing the @eject command.  The
default <VAR>message</VAR> is <SAMP>`You expel %d from %i.'</SAMP>
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@oejection</B> <I><VAR>message</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX88"></A>
This message is Printed to others in the room from which the ejection
occurs.  The default <VAR>message</VAR> is <SAMP>`%D is unceremoniously
expelled from %i.'</SAMP>
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@victim_ejection</B> <I><VAR>message</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX89"></A>
This message is Printed to the victim being ejected.  The default

</DL>




<H2><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC20">Rooms and Exits</A></H2>
<P>
Rooms and exits are the stuff from which the landscape of the virtual
world is created.  A <EM>room</EM> is generally an instance of the generic
room class, also referred to as <CODE>$room</CODE>.  An exit is an instance of
the generic exit class, <CODE>$exit</CODE>.   An exit can be thought of as a
one way tunnel leading from one room to another.  If you wish to have a
two way exit, you have to use two exits: one going from the <EM>source</EM>
to the <CODE>destination</CODE> and one going from the <CODE>destination</CODE> to
the <CODE>source</CODE>.


<P>
The following commands are used for creating and managing rooms and
exits: 


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@dig</B> <I>"<VAR>new-room-name</VAR>"</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX90"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@dig</B> <I><VAR>exit-spec</VAR> <STRONG>to</STRONG> "<VAR>new-room-name</VAR>"</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX91"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@dig</B> <I><VAR>exit-spec</VAR> <STRONG>to</STRONG> <VAR>old-room-object-number</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX92"></A>
This is the basic building tool.  The first form of the command creates
a new room with the given name.  The new room is not connected to
anywhere else; it is floating in limbo.  The <SAMP>`@dig'</SAMP> command tells
you its object number, though, so you can use the <SAMP>`@move'</SAMP> command
to get there easily.


<P>
The second form of the command not only creates the room, but one or two
exits linking your current location to (and possibly from) the new room.
An <VAR>exit-spec</VAR> has one of the following two forms:



<PRE>
<VAR>names</VAR>
<VAR>names</VAR>|<VAR>names</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
where the first form is used when you only want to create one exit, from
your current room to the new room, and the second form when you also
want an exit back, from the new room to your current room.  In any case,
the <VAR>names</VAR> piece is just a list of names for the exit, separated by
commas; these are the names of the commands players can type to use the
exit.  It is usually a good idea to include explicitly the standard
abbreviations for direction names (e.g., <SAMP>`n'</SAMP> for <SAMP>`north'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`se'</SAMP> for <SAMP>`southeast'</SAMP>, etc.).  DO NOT put spaces in the names
of exits; they are useless in MOO.


<P>
The third form of the command is just like the second form except that
no new room is created; you instead specify by object number the other
room to/from which the new exits will connect.


<P>
NOTE: You must own the room at one end or the other of the exits you
create.  If you own both, everything is hunky-dorey.  If you own only
one end, then after creating the exits you should write down their
object numbers.  You must then get the owner of the other room to use
<SAMP>`@add-exit'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`@add-entrance'</SAMP> to link your new exits to
their room.


<P>
For example,



<PRE>
@dig "The Conservatory"
</PRE>

<P>
creates a new room named "The Conservatory" and prints out its object number.



<PRE>
@dig north,n to "The North Pole"
</PRE>

<P>
creates a new room and also an exit linking the player's current
location to the new room; players would say either <SAMP>`north'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`n'</SAMP> to get from here to the new room.  No way to get back from that
room is created.



<PRE>
@dig west,w|east,e,out to "The Department of Auto-Musicology"
</PRE>

<P>
creates a new room and two exits, one taking players from here to the
new room (via the commands <SAMP>`west'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`w'</SAMP>) and one taking them
from the new room to here (via <SAMP>`east'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`e'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`out'</SAMP>).



<PRE>
@dig up,u to #7164
</PRE>

<P>
creates an exit leading from the player's current room to #7164, which
must be an existing room.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@add-exit</B> <I><VAR>exit-object-number</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX93"></A>
Add the exit with the given object number as a conventional exit from
the current room (that is, an exit that can be invoked simply by
uttering its name, like <SAMP>`east'</SAMP>).  Usually, <SAMP>`@dig'</SAMP> does this
for you, but it doesn't if you don't own the room in question.  Instead,
it tells you the object number of the new exit and you have to find the
owner of the room and get them to use the <SAMP>`@add-exit'</SAMP> command to
link it up.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@add-entrance</B> <I><VAR>exit-object-number</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX94"></A>
Add the exit with the given object number as a recognized entrance to
the current room (that is, one whose use is not considered
teleportation).  Usually, <SAMP>`@dig'</SAMP> does this for you, but it doesn't
if you don't own the room in question.  Instead, it tells you the object
number of the new exit and you have to find the owner of the room and
get them to use the @add-entrance command to link it up.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@exits</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX95"></A>

</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@entrances</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX96"></A>

considered to be teleportation.
</DL>




<H1><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC21">Notes and Letters</A></H1>
<P>
Notes and letters are objects that can have text written on them to be
read later.  They are useful for leaving messages to people, or for
documenting your creations.


<P>
Note that, like most objects, only the owner of a note can recycle it.
If you'd like to make it possible for a reader of your note to destroy
it (this is a common desire for notes to other individual players), then
you might want to look at using a <CODE>$letter</CODE> instead.




<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC22">Using Notes</A></H2>
<P>
You can make a note by creating a child of the standard note,
<CODE>$note</CODE>.  The following commands are available for interacting with
notes:


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>read</B> <I><VAR>note</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX97"></A>
Prints the text written on the named object, usually a note or letter.
Some notes are encrypted so that only certain players may read them.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>write</B> <I>"<VAR>any text</VAR>" <STRONG>on</STRONG> <VAR>note</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX98"></A>

</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>erase</B> <I><VAR>note</VAR></I>

</DL>




<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC23">Using Letters</A></H2>
<P>
A letter is a special kind of note with the added feature that it can be
recycled by anyone who can read it.  This is often useful for notes from
one player to another.  You create the letter as a child of the generic
letter, <CODE>$letter</CODE>, encrypt it so that only you and the other player
can read it and then either give it to the player
in question or leave it where they will find it.  Once they've read it,
they can use the <SAMP>`burn'</SAMP> command to recycle the letter.


<P>
The following command is available for letters, in addition to those
used for notes.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>burn</B> <I><VAR>letter</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX105"></A>
Destroy the named letter irretrievably.  Only players who can read the
letter can do this.
</DL>




<H1><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC24">Using Containers</A></H1>
<P>
Containers are objects that allow you to store other objects inside
them.  Containers may be open or closed, using the verbs <SAMP>`open'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`close'</SAMP> on the container.  Containers have a separate lock to
determine if a player may open them.  You can make a container by
creating a child of the standard container, <CODE>$container</CODE>.


<P>
Containers have a large number of messages which get printed when
players act upon them. 


<P>
Containers have opacity.  This is manipulated using the following
command :


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@opacity</B> <I><VAR>container</VAR> is <VAR>integer</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX106"></A>
The opacity can take on one of three values:

<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>0</CODE>
<DD>
- The container is transparent and you can always see into it.
<DT><CODE>1</CODE>
<DD>
- The container is opaque, and you cannot see into it when closed
<DT><CODE>2</CODE>
<DD>
- The container is a black hole, and you can never see into it whether
closed or open.
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
The default opacity is <SAMP>`1'</SAMP> - the container is opaque.
</DL>




<H1><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC25">Messages on Objects</A></H1>
<P>
Most objects have messages that are printed when a player succeeds or
fails in manipulating the object in some way.  Of course, the kinds of
messages printed are specific to the kinds of manipulations and those,
in turn, are specific to the kind of object.  Regardless of the kind of
object, though, there is a uniform means for listing the kinds of
messages that can be set and then for setting them.


<P>
The <SAMP>`@messages'</SAMP> command prints out all of the messages you can set
on any object you own.


<P>
To set a particular message on one of your objects use a command with
this form:



<PRE>
@<VAR>message-name</VAR> <VAR>object</VAR> is "<VAR>message</VAR>"
</PRE>

<P>
where <SAMP>`<VAR>message-name</VAR>'</SAMP> is the name of the message being set,
<VAR>object</VAR> is the name or number of the object on which you want to
set that message, and <VAR>message</VAR> is the actual text.


<P>
For example, consider the <SAMP>`leave'</SAMP> message on an exit; it is printed
to a player when they successfully use the exit to leave a room.  To set
the <SAMP>`leave'</SAMP> message on the exit <SAMP>`north'</SAMP> from the current room,
use the command



<PRE>
@leave north is "You wander in a northerly way out of the room."
</PRE>

<P>
This class of commands automatically applies to any property whose name
ends in <SAMP>`_msg'</SAMP>.  Thus, in the example above, the command is setting
the <SAMP>`leave_msg'</SAMP> property of the named exit.  You can get such a
command to work on new kinds of objects simply by giving the appropriate
properties names that end in <SAMP>`_msg'</SAMP>.


<P>
Messages of this type are used on the following objects:



<UL>
<LI>

containers
<LI>

exits
<LI>

things
</UL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@messages</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX107"></A>

current values.
</DL>




<H2><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC26">Setting Messages for Exits</A></H2>
<P>
Several kinds of messages can be set on an exit object ; they are
printed to various audiences at certain times whenever an attempt is
made to go through the exit.  The ones whose names begin with <SAMP>`o'</SAMP> are
always shown prefixed with the name of the player making the attempt and
a single space character.  The standard pronoun substitutions (with
respect to the player) are made on each message before it is printed.


<P>
The following commands can be used to set the corresponding messages on
an exit: 


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@leave</B> <I><VAR>message</VAR></I>

<H1><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC29">Using Locks With Objects</A></H1>
<P>
It is frequently useful to restrict the use of some object.  For
example, one might want to keep people from using a particular exit
unless they're carrying a bell, a book, and a candle.  Alternatively,
one might allow anyone to use the exit unless they're carrying that huge
golden coffin in the corner.  LambdaMOO supports a general locking
mechanism designed to make such restrictions easy to implement, usually
without any programming.


<P>
Every object supports a notion of being <EM>locked</EM> with respect to
certain other objects.  For example, the exit above might be locked for
any object that was carrying the coffin object but unlocked for all
other objects.  In general, if some object <SAMP>`A'</SAMP> is locked for
another object, <SAMP>`B'</SAMP>, then <SAMP>`B'</SAMP> is usually prevented from using
<SAMP>`A'</SAMP>.  Of course, the meaning of <EM>use</EM> in this context depends
upon the kind of object.


<P>
The various standard classes of objects use locking as follows:

<UL>
<LI>

Rooms and containers refuse to allow any object inside them if they're locked for it.
<LI>

Exits refuse to transport any object that they're locked for.
<LI>

Things (including notes and letters) cannot be moved to locations that they're locked for.
</UL>

<P>
There are two sides to locking:

<UL>
<LI>

How is it specified whether one object is locked for another one?
<LI>

What is the effect of an object being locked?
</UL>

<P>
Note that these two questions are entirely independent: one could invent
a brand-new way to specify locking, but the effect of an exit being
locked would be unchanged.


<P>
Programmers should note that the interface between these two sides is
the verb 



<PRE>
<VAR>x</VAR>:is_unlocked_for(<VAR>y</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
which is called by <VAR>x</VAR> to determine if it
is locked for the object <VAR>y</VAR>.  The way in which
<CODE>:is_unlocked_for</CODE> is implemented is entirely independent of the
ways in which <VAR>x</VAR> uses its results.  Note that you can play on
either side of this interface with your own objects, either defining new
implementations of <CODE>:is_unlocked_for</CODE> that match your particular
circumstances or having your objects interpret their being locked in new
ways.


<P>
The following commands are used to specify locks on objects.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@lock</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> <STRONG>with</STRONG> <VAR>key expression</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX137"></A>

</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@unlock</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX138"></A>
Clear any lock that might exist on the given object.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@lock_for_open</B> <I><VAR>container</VAR> <STRONG>with</STRONG> <VAR>key expression</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX139"></A>
Set the lock on <VAR>container</VAR> which restricts who can open it.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@unlock_for_open</B> <I><VAR>container</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX140"></A>
Clears the lock which restricts who may open <VAR>container</VAR>.
</DL>




<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC30">Keys</A></H2>
<P>
LambdaMOO supports a simple but powerful notation for specifying locks
on objects, encryption on notes, and other applications.  The idea is to
describe a constraint that must be satisfied concerning what some object
must be or contain in order to use some other object.


<P>
The constraint is given in the form of a logical expression, made up of
object numbers connected with the operators <SAMP>`and'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`or'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`not'</SAMP>
(written <SAMP>`&#38;&#38;'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`||'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`!'</SAMP>, for compatibility with the MOO programming
language).  When writing such expressions, though, one usually does not
use object numbers directly, but rather gives their names, as with most
MOO commands.


<P>
These logical expressions (called <EM>key expressions</EM>) are always
evaluated in the context of some particular <EM>candidate</EM> object, to see
if that object meets the constraint.  To do so, we consider the
candidate object, along with every object it contains (and the ones
those objects contain, and so on), to be <SAMP>`true'</SAMP> and all other objects to
be <SAMP>`false'</SAMP>.


<P>
As an example, suppose the player blip wanted to lock the exit leading
to his home so that only he and the holder of his magic wand could use
it.  Further, suppose that blip was object #999 and the wand was #1001.
blip would use the '@lock' command to lock the exit with the following
key expression:



<PRE>
me || magic wand
</PRE>

<P>
and the system would understand this to mean



<PRE>
#999 || #1001
</PRE>

<P>
That is, players could only use the exit if they were (or were carrying)
either #999 or #1001.


<P>
To encrypt a note so that it could only be read by blip or someone
carrying his book, his bell, and his candle, blip would use the
<SAMP>`encrypt'</SAMP> command with the key expression



<PRE>
me || (bell &#38;&#38; book &#38;&#38; candle)
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, to keep players from taking a large gold coffin through a
particularly narrow exit, blip would use this key expression:

<PRE>
! coffin
</PRE>

<P>
That is, the expression would be false for any object that was or was
carrying the coffin.


<P>
There is one other kind of clause that can appear in a key expression:



<PRE>
? <VAR>object</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
This is evaluated by testing whether the given object is unlocked for
the candidate object; if so, this clause is true, and otherwise, it is
false.  This allows you to have several locks all sharing some single
other one; when the other one is changed, all of the locks change their
behavior simultaneously.


<P>
The internal representation of key expressions, as stored in .key on
every object, for example, is very simple and easy to construct on the
fly.




<H3><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC31">Key Representation</A></H3>
<P>
The representation of key expressions is very simple and makes it easy
to construct new keys on the fly.


<P>
Objects are represented by their object numbers and all other kinds of
key expressions are represented by lists.  These lists have as their
first element a string drawn from the following set:



<PRE>
"&#38;&#38;"     "||"     "!"     "?"
</PRE>

<P>
For the first two of these, the list should be three elements long; the
second and third elements are the representations of the key expressions
on the left- and right-hand sides of the appropriate operator.  In the
third case, <SAMP>`!'</SAMP>, the list should be two elements long; the second
element is again a representation of the operand.  Finally, in the <SAMP>`?'</SAMP>
case, the list is also two elements long but the second element must be
an object number.


<P>
As an example, the key expression



<PRE>
#45  &#38;&#38;  ?#46  &#38;&#38;  (#47  ||  !#48)
</PRE>

<P>
would be represented as follows:



<PRE>
{"&#38;&#38;", {"&#38;&#38;", #45, {"?", #46}}, {"||", #47, {"!", #48}}}
</PRE>



<H1><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC32">The MOO Editor</A></H1>
<P>
One can always enter an editor by teleporting to it, or you can use one
of the commands provided



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>@edit     <VAR>object</VAR>:<VAR>verb</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
invokes the Verb Editor (edits verb code)
<DT><CODE>@notedit  <VAR>note_object</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
invokes the Note Editor (edits note text)
<DT><CODE>@notedit  <VAR>object</VAR>.<VAR>prop</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
invokes the Note Editor (edits text property)
<DT><CODE>@send     <VAR>list of recipients</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
invokes the Mailer (edits a mail message)
<DT><CODE>@answer   [<VAR>msg_number</VAR>] [<VAR>flags</VAR>...]</CODE>
<DD>
invokes the Mailer (edits a reply)
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
This will transport you to one of several special rooms that have
editing commands available.  These editors are admittedly not as good as
EMACS, but for those with no other editing capability on their host
systems, it is better than nothing.


<P>
In addition to the commands provided by the generic editor, individual
editors provide their own additional commands for loading text from
places, saving text to places, and various specialized functions.


<P>
Note that a given editor only allows you one session at a time (ie. one
verb, one note, or one mail message).  If you leave an editor without
either aborting or compiling/saving/sending the item you're working on,
that editor remembers what you are doing next time you enter it, whether
you enter it by teleporting or by using the appropriate command.  Note
that editors are periodically flushed so if you leave stuff there for
sufficiently long, it will go away.


<P>
A player may have his own <CODE>.edit_options</CODE> property which is a list
containing one or more (string) flags from the following list



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>quiet_insert</CODE>
<DD>
suppresses those annoying <SAMP>`Line n added.'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`Appended...'</SAMP>
messages that one gets in response to <SAMP>`say'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`emote'</SAMP>.  This
is useful if you're entering a long list of lines, perhaps via some
macro on your client, and you don't want to see an equally long list of
<SAMP>`Line n added...'</SAMP> messages.  What you do want, however is some
indication that this all got through, which is why the <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> command
is an abbreviation for insert.
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
There will be more options, some day.




<H2><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC33">Editor Ranges</A></H2>
<P>
Most editor commands act upon a particular range of lines.  Essentially,
one needs to specify a first line and a last line.  Line numbers may be
given in any of the following forms
  

<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>n</CODE>
<DD>
(i.e., the nth line of text)
<DT><CODE>n^</CODE>
<DD>
n-th line after/below  the current insertion point
<DT><CODE>n_</CODE>
<DD>
n-th line before/above the current insertion point
<DT><CODE>n$</CODE>
<DD>
n-th line before the end.
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
In the latter three, n defaults to 1, so that <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> by itself refers
to the line below the current (i.e., the line that gets <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> printed
before it), and likewise for <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> while <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> refers to the last
line.  Note that the usage depends on whether you are specifying a line
or an insertion point (space between lines). <SAMP>`^5'</SAMP> is the space
above/before line 5, while <SAMP>`5^'</SAMP> is the fifth line after/below the
current insertion point.


<P>
Ranges of lines may be specified in any of the
following ways:



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>line</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
just that line
<DT><CODE>from <VAR>line</VAR> to <VAR>line</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
what it says; the following two forms are equivalent:

<PRE>
<VAR>line</VAR>-<VAR>line</VAR>            
<VAR>line</VAR> <VAR>line</VAR>
</PRE>

</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
With the <SAMP>`from l to l'</SAMP> form, either the <STRONG>from</STRONG> or the
<STRONG>to</STRONG> can be left off and it will default to whatever is usual for
that command (usually a line above or below the insertion point).




<H2><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC34">Editor Commands</A></H2>

<P>
The following commands are provided by the editor classes.  Those that
are not generic are specifically marked so.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>say</B> <I><VAR>text</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX141"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>"<VAR>text</VAR></B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX142"></A>
Adds <VAR>text</VAR> to whatever you are editing.  The second form is
equivalent to the first except in that it doesn't strip leading blanks
off of <VAR>text</VAR> (just as with the normal <SAMP>`say'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`"'</SAMP>
commands).


<P>
The added text appears as a new line at the insertion point.  The
insertion point, in turn, gets moved so as to be after the added text.
For example:



<PRE>
&#62;"first line
-|Line 1 added.

&#62;"  second line"
-|Line 2 added.

&#62;list
-|1: first line
-|__2_   second line"
-|^^^^
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>emote</B> <I><VAR>text</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX143"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>:<VAR>text</VAR></B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX144"></A>


<P>
Appends <VAR>text</VAR> to the end of the line before the insertion point.
The second form is equivalent to the first except that it doesn't strip
leading blanks off of <VAR>text</VAR> (just as with the normal <SAMP>`emote'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> commands).  The insertion point is left unmoved.



<PRE>
&#62;list .
-|_37_ Hello there
-|^38^ Oh, I'm fine.

&#62;:, how are you
-|Appended to line 37.

&#62;:?
-|Appended to line 37.

</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>lis*t</B> <I>[<VAR>range</VAR>]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX145"></A>
Prints some subset of the current verb text.  The default range is some
reasonable collection of lines around the current insertion point:
currently this is <SAMP>`8_-8^'</SAMP>, ie., 8 lines above the insertion point
to 8 lines below it unless this runs up against the beginning or end of
file, in which case we just take the first or last 16 lines, or just
<SAMP>`1-$'</SAMP> if there aren't that many.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>ins*ert</B> <I>[<VAR>ins</VAR>] ["<VAR>text</VAR>]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX146"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>.</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX147"></A>
Many editor commands refer to an "insertion point" which is (usually)
the place right below where the most recent line was inserted.  The
insertion point should really be thought of as sitting <EM>between</EM>
lines.  In listings, the line above the insertion point is marked with
<SAMP>`_'</SAMP> while the one below is marked with <SAMP>`^'</SAMP>.


<P>
The <SAMP>`insert'</SAMP> command, when given an argument, sets the insertion
point.  If <VAR>text</VAR> is provided, a new line will be created and
inserted as with <SAMP>`say'</SAMP>.  <VAR>ins</VAR>, both here and in other commands
that require specifying an insertion point (e.g., copy/move), can be one
of



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>^n</CODE>
<DD>

<DT><CODE>n</CODE>
<DD>
above line n
<DT><CODE>_n</CODE>
<DD>

<DT><CODE>$</CODE>
<DD>
at the end
<DT><CODE>^$</CODE>
<DD>
before the last line
<DT><CODE>n^$</CODE>
<DD>

<DT><CODE>.</CODE>
<DD>
the current insertion point  (i.e., <SAMP>`insert .'</SAMP> is a no-op)
<DT><CODE>+n</CODE>

n lines below the current insertion point.
<DT><CODE>-n</CODE>

<DD><A NAME="IDX152"></A>
Searches for the first line after <VAR>ins</VAR> containing <VAR>str</VAR>.
<VAR>ins</VAR> defaults to the current insertion point .  With the first
form, any character (not just <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>) may be used as a delimiter.  For
the second form, you must use <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>.  The <SAMP>`c'</SAMP> flag, if given,

Substitutes <VAR>str2</VAR> for <VAR>str1</VAR>, in all of the lines of
<VAR>range</VAR>.  Any character (not just <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>) may be used to delimit
the strings.  If <VAR>str1</VAR> is blank, <VAR>str2</VAR> is inserted at the
beginning of the line.  (For inserting a string at the end of a line use
<SAMP>`emote'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`:'</SAMP>).


<P>
Normally, only one substitution is done per line in the specified range,
but if the <SAMP>`g'</SAMP> flag is given, *all* instances of <VAR>str1</VAR> are
replaced.  The <SAMP>`c'</SAMP> flag indicates that case is not significant when
searching for substitution instances.  <VAR>range</VAR> defaults to the line
*before* the insertion point.


<P>
You do <EM>not</EM> need a space between the verb and the delimiter before
<VAR>str1</VAR>.  [Bug: If you omit the space and the first whitespace in
<VAR>str1</VAR> is a run of more than one space, those spaces get treated as

<H1><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC35">Dealing with Verbs and Properties</A></H1>

<P>
Verbs and properties are the elements of objects that make them useful.
A verb allows you to define things to do with an object, and properties
are used to store state information about the object.  A verb can be
thought of as a MOO code program, executed when the verb on the object
is invoked.  This can happen if the LambdaMOO parser matches the user
input with the verb on an object, or when another MOO code program
explicitly calls the verb.


<P>
Several commands are available to allow manipulation of properties and
verbs.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@show</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX183"></A>

<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@show</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR>:<VAR>verb-name</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX185"></A>
Displays quite detailed information about an object, property or verb,
including its name, owner, permission bits, etc.  The information
displayed for an object can be quite long, but usually fits on most
screens.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@chmod</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR> <VAR>object-permissions</VAR></I>

<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@chmod</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR>:<VAR>verb-name</VAR> <VAR>verb-permissions</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX188"></A>
Changes the permissions of an object, property or verb, to those given.
The following table shows what permission bits are allowed for each form
of the command:



<PRE>

Changes the parent of the named object to be the named parent.  The
object acquires all the verb and property definitions of its parent, as
well as the parent's values for any newly-defined properties.  The
parent object must be readable by the player in order to use it as a new
parent.
</DL>




<H2><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC36">Dealing with Verbs</A></H2>

<DD><A NAME="IDX193"></A>


<P>
Adds a new verb with the given name(s) to the named object.  If there
are multiple names, they should be separated by spaces and all enclosed
in quotes:



<PRE>
@verb foo:"bar baz mum*ble"
</PRE>

<P>
The direct and indirect object specifiers (<VAR>dobj</VAR> and <VAR>iobj</VAR>)
must be either <SAMP>`none'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`this'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`any'</SAMP>; their meaning is
discussed in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual.  The preposition
specifier (<VAR>prep</VAR>) must be either <SAMP>`none'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`any'</SAMP>, or one of
the prepositional phrases possible. (a prepositional phrase with more
than one word must be enclosed in quotes ("")).  All three specifiers
default to <SAMP>`none'</SAMP>.


<P>
It is also possible to specify the new verb's permissions and owner as
part of the same command (rather than having to issue separate
<SAMP>`@chmod/@chown'</SAMP> commands), using the third and fourth forms above.


<P>
<VAR>permissions</VAR> are as with @chmod, i.e., must be some subset of
<SAMP>`rwxd'</SAMP>.  They default to <SAMP>`rxd'</SAMP> (specifying <SAMP>`w'</SAMP> for a verb
is highly inadvisable).  The owner defaults to the player typing the
command; only wizards can create verbs with owners other than
themselves.

<DD><A NAME="IDX197"></A>
Changes the direct object, preposition, and/or indirect object
specifiers for the named verb on the named object.  Any specifiers not
provided on the command line are not changed.  The direct and indirect
object specifiers (<VAR>dobj</VAR> and <VAR>iobj</VAR>) must be either
<SAMP>`none'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`this'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`any'</SAMP>.  The preposition specifier
(<VAR>prep</VAR>) must be either <SAMP>`none'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`any'</SAMP>, or one of the
prepositional phrases that are possible.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>.program</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR>:<VAR>verb-name</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX198"></A>
Provides or changes the MOO program associated with the named verb on
the named object.


<P>
This command works differently from all other MOO commands, in that it
actually changes how the server will interpret later lines that you type
to it.  After typing the <SAMP>`.program'</SAMP> line, you are in <EM>programming
mode</EM>.  All lines that you type in this mode are simply saved away in
the server until you type a line containing only a single period (<SAMP>`.'</SAMP>).
At that point, those lines are interpreted as a MOO program and are
checked for syntax errors.  If none are found, a message to that effect
is printed and the code you typed is installed as the program for the
verb in question.  In any case, after typing the <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> line, you are
returned to the normal input-handling mode.

<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@list</B> <I><VAR>object</VAR>:<VAR>verb</VAR> <STRONG>with parentheses without numbers</STRONG></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX202"></A>
Prints out the code for the MOO program associated with the named verb
on the named object.  Normally, the code is shown with each line
numbered and with only those parentheses that are necessary to show the
meaning of the program.  By specifying options as shown in the last
three forms above, you can have the numbers omitted and/or all
parentheses included.


<P>
For example, 



<PRE>

<DD><A NAME="IDX204"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>;</B> <I><VAR>MOO-code</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX205"></A>
Evaluates the given piece of MOO code and prints the resulting value.
If the MOO code begins with one of the MOO language keywords (<SAMP>`if'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`for'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`while'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`fork'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`return'</SAMP>) or with the
character <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>, then the entire piece of code is treated as the
program for a verb, with <SAMP>`;'</SAMP> appended to the end.  Otherwise,
<SAMP>`return'</SAMP> is appended to the front and <SAMP>`;'</SAMP> is appended to the
end and that string is treated as the code for a verb.  In either case,
the resulting verb is invoked and whatever value it returns is printed.


<P>
For programmers, this is such a mind-bogglingly useful thing to do that
there is a simple abbreviation for this command; any command beginning
with a semicolon (<SAMP>`;'</SAMP>) is treated as a use of <SAMP>`eval'</SAMP>.


<P>

<H1><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC39">Using Tasks</A></H1>
<P>
A task is an execution of a MOO program.  There are three ways for tasks
to be created in LambdaMOO:



<UL>
<LI>

Every time a player types a command, a task is created to execute that
command; we call these <EM>command tasks</EM>.
<LI>

Whenever a player connects or disconnects from the MOO, the server
starts a task to do whatever processing is necessary, such as printing
out <SAMP>`blip has connected'</SAMP> to all of the players in the same room; these
are called <EM>server tasks</EM>.
<LI>

The <CODE>fork()</CODE> statement in the programming language creates a task
whose execution is delayed for at least some given number of seconds;
these are <EM>forked tasks</EM>.
</UL>

<P>
To prevent a maliciously- or incorrectly-written MOO program from
running forever and monopolizing the server, limits are placed on the
running time of every task.  One limit is that no task is allowed to run
longer than one minute; this limit is, in practice, never reached.  The
reason is that there is a second limit on the number of operations a
task may execute.


<P>
Every task has an associated <EM>clock</EM> that counts down <EM>ticks</EM> as the
task executes.  The server counts one tick for every expression
evaluation (other than variables and literals) and one for every time
through the body of a loop.  If a task's clock winds all the way down to
zero, the task is immediately and unceremoniously aborted.


<P>
Command and server tasks are given brand-new clocks with an initial
store of 20,000 ticks; this is enough for almost all normal uses.


<P>
A forked task inherits the clock of the task that forked it, with
however many ticks remain on it.  To allow objects like cuckoo clocks
and other recurring tasks that do a little bit of work every once in a
while forever, clocks also regain ticks at the rate of 25 ticks per
second, up to the maximum of 20,000 ticks.  The seconds are counted from
the end of the time that one task was counting down that clock to the
time when the next user of that clock actually begins execution.


<P>
Because forked tasks may exist for long periods of time before they
begin execution, there are commands to list the ones that you own and to
kill them before they execute.  These commands are covered in the
following section.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@forked</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX211"></A>
Gives a list of all of the forked tasks you own, along with detailed
information about each one.  The information includes the following:



<PRE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Queue ID:</CODE>
<DD>
A numeric identifier for the task, for use in killing it .
<DT><CODE>Start Time:</CODE>
<DD>
The time after which the task will begin execution.
<DT><CODE>Owner:</CODE>
<DD>
You, if you're not a wizard.
<DT><CODE>Clock:</CODE>
<DD>
The number of ticks left on the clock for the task right this moment; if
the task does not execute immediately, this number will grow, up to a
maximum of 20,000 ticks.
<DT><CODE>Clock ID:</CODE>
<DD>
It is possible for several tasks to share a single clock.  The clock ID
is a numeric identifier for each clock, so that you can tell if one is
being shared.
<DT><CODE>Verb:</CODE>
<DD>
The object and verb-name of the code that forked the task.
<DT><CODE>Line:</CODE>
<DD>
The line number of the first statement that the task will execute when
it starts.  Note that the code for the verb in question may have changed
since the task was forked; the forked task will use the version that was
being executed when it was forked.
</DL>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@kill</B> <I><VAR>queue-id</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX212"></A>
Immediately kills the forked task with the given numeric queue ID.  The
<SAMP>`@forked'</SAMP> command is useful for finding out these queue IDs.  Only
the owner of a task may kill it.
</DL>




<H1><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="LambdaCoreUserMan_toc.html#TOC40">Miscellaneous</A></H1>
<P>
The following verbs are useful, but not easily categorisable.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@version</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX213"></A>
Prints out the version number for the currently-executing MOO server.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@lastlog</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX214"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@lastlog</B> <I><VAR>player</VAR></I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX215"></A>
The first form prints out a list of all players, roughly sorted by how
long it's been since that player last connected to the MOO.  For each
player, the precise time of their last connection is printed.


<P>
The second form only shows the last-connection time for the named
player.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>@memory</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX216"></A>
Prints out all information available on the current memory-usage
behavior of the MOO server.  Probably only a wizard, if anyone, cares
about this.
</DL>
