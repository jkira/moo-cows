<H3><A NAME="SEC60" HREF="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC60">Flushing Unprocessed Input</A></H3>

<P>
It sometimes happens that a user changes their mind about having typed one or
more lines of input and would like to `untype' them before the server actually
gets around to processing them.  If they react quickly enough, they can type
their connection's defined <STRONG>flush</STRONG> command; when the server first reads
that command from the network, it immediately and completely flushes any as-yet
unprocessed input from that user, printing a message to the user describing
just which lines of input were discarded, if any.

<P>
<EM>Fine point:</EM> The flush command is handled very early in the server's
processing of a line of input, before the line is entered into the task queue
for the connection and well before it is parsed into words like other commands.
For this reason, it must be typed exactly as it was defined, alone on the line,
without quotation marks, and without any spaces before or after it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
When a connection is first accepted by the server, it is given an initial flush
command setting taken from the current default.  This initial setting can be
changed later using the <CODE>set_connection_option()</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
By default, each connection is initially given <SAMP>`.flush'</SAMP> as its flush
command.  If the property <CODE>$server_options.default_flush_command</CODE> exists,
then its value overrides this default.  If
<CODE>$server_options.default_flush_command</CODE> is a non-empty string, then that
string is the flush command for all new connections; otherwise, new connections
are initially given no flush command at all.
