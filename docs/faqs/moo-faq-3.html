<h2><a name="ss3.1">3.1</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc3.1">Where can I find the answer to...</a>
</h2>

<p>Always try the FAQ and the MOO-Cows archives, and FAQs about other
subjects if they apply.  Pointers to the archives and sources to get
other forms of this FAQ are in the Resources section.  The next
question has some pointers to UNIX resources for UNIX questions.</p>
<p>Also look at the 
<a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/lcore-getting-started.html">introduction to LambdaCore</a>
document that comes with the latest LambdaCore.</p>

</h2>

<p>You might be interested in reading one or more 
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.unix.questions.html">comp.unix.question FAQs</a>.  Reading other
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/</a> 
might give you more information about your
particular flavor of UNIX.   Another good source of answers is

<h2><a name="ss3.3">3.3</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc3.3">I want to port something from one MOO to another.  Who do I ask for permission?</a>
</h2>

<p>The owner of the object.  If you can't get in touch with the owner
and the object's description doesn't <b>explicitly</b> grant
permission to port, assume you can't port the object.  If the owner of
the object is not a real player (e.g. hacker), then contact the
administrators of the MOO.  The 
<a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/Copyright-FAQ/top.html">USENET Copyright FAQ</a> is a good source for information about
copyrights.  Note that an object being on a MOO and readable by
everyone isn't sufficient permission to port it to another MOO.
Finally, If the object isn't a generic object, ask yourself if you
really want to port it or if you instead want to make an original object.</p>

<h2><a name="ss3.4">3.4</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc3.4">What are some good clients to use with MOO?</a>
</h2>

<p>Most people prefer to use TinyFugue or the emacs client, mud.el.
mud.el is available at
<a href="ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/MOO/clients/">PARC's FTP site</a>.</p>

<p>Other clients are available at
<a href="ftp://ftp.math.okstate.edu/pub/muds/clients">ftp://ftp.math.okstate.edu/pub/muds/clients</a></p>

<p>VMS users might be interested in the port of tinyfugue 2.x by Mike Shiminok.
It's available from 
<a href="ftp://ftp.math.okstate.edu/pub/muds/clients/tfvms">ftp://ftp.math.okstate.edu/pub/muds/clients/tfvms</a>.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.awns.com/tkMOO-light/">tkMOO-light</a>
is an advanced chat client which supports local editing,
MacMOOSE, programmable triggers and MCP. The client uses Sun's free
cross-platform environment Tcl/Tk
and runs on UNIX, Windows95, Windows NT and Macintosh platforms.</p>

<h2><a name="ss3.5">3.5</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc3.5">How do I change my MOO password?  I've forgotten or lost the password to #2!  How do I log into my MOO?</a>
</h2>

<p>If you are using LambdaMOO 1.8.0 or later, run the MOO server in
emergency wizard mode, eval #2.password = crypt("new-password"), and
quit saving the database.   Once you do this, #2's password should
be set to "new-password".
</p><pre> unix:~&gt; moo -e yourdb.db yourdb.new
 MOO (#2):  eval #2.password = crypt("new-password")
 MOO (#2): quit
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>If you are using an older version of the server and if you are
still capable of connecting as the wizard (i.e., you either haven't
yet given the wizard a password or you know the current one), then the
command
</p><pre>   @password (old-password) (new-password)
</pre>

will do it (where (old-password) is just omitted if this is the first 
time you're giving the wizard a password).<p></p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you cannot currently connect as that wizard,
but you can connect as some other wizard, then the somewhat more
arcane command
</p><pre>   ;#2.password = crypt("new-password")
</pre>

will do it (where `new-password' is the new password).<p></p>

<p>Finally, if you're completely locked out of all available wizard
accounts, then you're down to the nitty-gritty task of hand-editing
the database file.  First, while the MOO is running, connect as some
programmer and type</p>
<p>
</p><pre>   ;crypt("foo")
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>It will give you back a random-looking string.  Write it down
<b>very</b> precisely, making sure to match case.  Then,
bring the database file into your favorite text editor and search for
the string ``#2'' all alone on a line.  It should be followed, on the
next line, by the name of the wizard (probably `Wizard' if it hasn't
been changed since the MOO was started).  Scroll down a ways (perhaps
quite a ways, but not past the place that has `#3' all alone on a
line) until you find another random-looking string the same length as
the one crypt() returned above.  Replace that string with the one you
wrote down and save the file.  You should now be able to log in as the
wizard using the password `foo'. </p>
