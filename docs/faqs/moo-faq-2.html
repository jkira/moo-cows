<h2><a name="ss2.1">2.1</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc2.1">Where can I get the Programmer's Manual?</a>
</h2>

<p>The LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual is a complete reference for all
database-independent aspects of the LambdaMOO system, including the
programming language, built-in functions, and command parser.</p>

<p>The 
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO/html/ProgrammersManual_toc.html">Programmer"s Manual</a>
is available at 
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO">ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO</a>
The file name is `ProgrammersManual.*' where `*' is the format tag.  It is
available in
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO/ProgrammersManual.dvi.Z">DVI</a>,
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO/ProgrammersManual.ps.Z">PostScript</a>,
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO/ProgrammersManual.texinfo">TeXInfo</a>, and
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO/ProgrammersManual.txt">plain text</a> 
formats.</p>

<h2><a name="ss2.2">2.2</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc2.2">Is there a way to incorporate new features of LambdaCore into my MOO's DB?</a>
</h2>

<p>There is no easy way to merge databases. The easiest thing to do is
just snag the code from LambdaMOO or somewhere and build/rebuild
the objects by hand. (For information on how to do so, see `help @dump'
on LambdaMOO.)</p>

<h2><a name="ss2.3">2.3</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc2.3">Objects like $room and $player are part of the `core' of the MOO. How do I add new ones?</a>
</h2>

<p>As documented in the Programmer's Manual
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO/html/ProgrammersManual_24.html#SEC24">Getting and Setting the Values of Properties</a>,
$name refers to the property on the system object (#0) named
"name".</p>
<p>Therefore, object references such as `$player' are created by
adding a property of that name to the system object (#0) and
storing the appropriate object's number in that property. For
example, referencing $room is the same as referencing
#0.room.</p>
<p>When the verb <code>@make-core-database</code> is run, it searches the
system object for these links in order to determine which objects
belong in the core. Newer releases of the LambdaMOO core include
the wizard verb <code>@corify</code> which will add the specified object to
the core in the manner illustrated  as well as checking additional
features such as an `init_for_core' verb being programmed on the
object.</p>


<h2><a name="ss2.4">2.4</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc2.4">$spell is HUGE.  How can I recycle it without running out of ticks or seconds?</a>
</h2>

<p>Mr. Spell is so large that he can't be deleted in the conventional manner. What you need to do is this:
</p><pre>   ;recycle($spell)
   @rmprop #0.spell
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>This leaves a hole in the database however. You can easily live with it
but if you find that you can't, just fill it by doing this:</p>
<p>
</p><pre>  ;$recycler:_recycle(renumber(create(#1)));
  ;reset_max_object()
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>Another option is to call $spell:clearall() and recycle the object
as usual.  This takes longer, but it does leave you the option of
using $spell later, or with a smaller dictionary (by not recycling
it).  $spell without the dictionary is not very big.  </p>

<h2><a name="ss2.5">2.5</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc2.5">How do I do execute a verb automatically each time the server starts?</a>
</h2>

<p>When the server starts, it calls the verb #0:server_started.
Create or alter that verb to have it call the verb you want to execute.</p>
<p>If a task has suspended or forked, and its execution is still pending
when the server checkpoints or is shutdown, that task is saved along
with the rest of the database. Thus, when the server is restarted,
that task will be resumed.</p>

<h2><a name="ss2.6">2.6</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc2.6">How can I make an object in a room listen to everything that's being said?</a>
</h2>

<p>When something is said in a room, each object in that room is sent
that text via the verb <code>tell</code>. You can change this verb to do whatever
you want it to whenever anything is said or done in a room.</p>

<h2><a name="ss2.7">2.7</a> <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/moo-faq/moo-faq.html#toc2.7">My MOO checkpoints every hour. I want to change this but I don't know where to look.</a>
</h2>

<p>Change the value of the property <code>#0.dump_interval</code> to the desired
number of seconds between dumps; the change will take effect after the
next checkpoint.</p>
<p>This is documented in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual,
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO/html/ProgrammersManual_65.html#SEC65">Checkpointing the Database</a>.</p>
