do not think he would object to my answering his questions publicly.

Here are some of the biggest problems with the MOO as a basis for future work:

Scalability: The MOO's single-server orientation, with the fundamental
assumption that all of the state of the whole world is immediately accessible
and under central control, is a major impediment to future work.  For example,
it is unclear that one can put together a useful Jupiter server on this basis
that serves even all of PARC (~350 full-time users), let alone all of the Xerox
Corporation, all of the active astronomical research community, etc.

Concurrency: The MOO's *deep* reliance, at both the server-code and DB-code
levels, on single-threaded atomic execution effectively prevents both a
coherent notion of distributed service (since distribution strongly implies
concurrency) and even single-server scalability through the use of a
multiprocessor machine.

Security: The MOO's current access-control mechanisms are very rigid and quite
inconvenient for, I would claim, the vast majority of real applications.  Not
only are we stuck with the simplistic r/w-bit model of the UNIX file system,
but we don't even have the important `group' level of control; it's all owner
or world permissions, far too coarse a granularity.  What's required for a
large number of applications is very fine-grained control over access, such as
would be provided by a `capability-based' operating system.  In such systems,
access to a resource is available only to those entities who have explicitly
received an unforgeable `handle' on the resource.  You can think of such a
handle as being like a MOO object reference, except that there's no way to
`create' the handle from whole cloth; it must be given to you (e.g. as an
argument or result of a function call) by an entity that already has it.

Other major security problems in the MOO are the uncontrollable public-ness of
many object relationships, such as the location/contents and parent/children
hierarchies, and the severe accountability problems with the current
ticks_left()/seconds_left() and queued_tasks()/kill_task() models.

Access to outside resources: The MOO was designed, from the beginning, to
effectively and completely prevent access by DB code to the various resources
in the host system, such as its files, system calls, devices, etc.  Because of
the severely restricted security models mentioned above, there isn't any
reasonable way to provide such complete access now.

There are a great host of other substantial flaws, but I don't want to take the
time right now to go into them in detail; suffice to say that they are so
numerous, deep, and significant that MOO can only be used for a certain
approximate level of prototyping for the kinds of systems and applications I'm
interested in building.

> How does this influence the MOO's development (i.e. new versions etc)?

I fully intend to make a number of substantial incremental improvements to MOO
over the next year or so, probably covering the vast majority of what I listed
in my infamous `1.8.X feature list' and still quite possibly including the
long-promised disk-basing facility.  My major motivations for continuing this
line of development are (1) meeting the near-term needs of the Jupiter project,
to allow us to get all of the research benefit out of that system prototype
that appears within easy reach, and (2) making good on the most important of
the explicit commitments I've made to the MOO user community over the years.
My motivations do *not* include trying to make MOO the best MUD server in
existence; I now believe that MUDs, as currently understood at large, are
nearing their end of useful life, and trying to make the best of a dying breed
is not very appealing to me.

> What do you have in mind for 'its successor'? Is it something you're
> working on, planning?

Yes.  We have for some time been planning a new project here at PARC to design,
build, and freely release a system we call the Fabric, a fully distributed,
robust, secure, and powerful computational and communications substrate.  The
Fabric will be designed and implemented specifically to support a single,
Internet-spanning social virtual reality; you wouldn't be far off to think of
the Fabric as being the SVR equivalent of the Web, with literally many millions
of independent servers loosely cooperating to create the illusion of a vast,
seamless virtual space that eventually encompasses the whole of the Internet
and all of its available information and service resources.

For a set of stories we've written about what we think it will be like for
normal people to use the Fabric, take a look at
        ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/MOO/papers/NII-Scenarios.txt
which is an article we wrote for a recent issue of the newsletter of Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility.

We anticipate beginning serious work on the Fabric in March, after finishing
the technical work for the Jupiter release to the net.  I'm guesstimating a
full-scale public release for the Fabric during the winter of 1996-7.

<A NAME="praise">My</A> advice is that you at least mostly continue as you have been, since you have
a large investment in your current work and the amount of improvement you could
hope for on any other available platform seems relatively limited in comparison
to the amount of work required to shift.  The one possible exception to this,
in my opinion, is Rob Leslie's LPMOO server, assuming that it can provide
sufficiently good performance; I single out this possible option because it
provides a very easy transition path to a system that can be extended in
interesting ways more easily than can the LambdaMOO server.  His code is still
relatively untested in a production environment, though, especially in the
context of a large database and user community; I would not consider using it
at LambdaMOO, for example, until after a number of medium-sized systems had had
some success with it.  This is not a criticism of Rob's work, by the way, which
I have reason to believe is exemplary; every system encounters new challenges
as it is used under more demanding circumstances.

Thanks for the offer; so far, we haven't been able to figure out a plausible
and efficient way to share the actual development effort, but we will be
needing substantial assistance in about a year, when we begin the first
small-scale but large-dispersion tests of the Fabric; I expect to be contacting
a number of my MOO acquaintances from all over the world when the time comes...

I have long regretted those words, from `version.h' in the release; indeed, I
broke this promise in the very first release after these words were written, as
you can see from comments near the top of `ChangeLog.txt'.

Conceivably, but our plans for the Fabric are so ambitious, and so much
potential is at stake, that I feel extremely uncomfortable with the idea that
backward compatibility with MOO might be a design requirement.  If we are at
all successful, the amount of MOO code in the world at this moment will be but
a tiny speck in comparison to what will be written in Fable, the Fabric's
programming language.  As I pointed out above, the MOO programming model is
terribly flawed when seen in the light of the Fabric project's goals; catering
to it now could easily cripple the project from the outset.

While I do not expect that automatic conversion from MOO to the Fabric will be
possible, I do think that it should be relatively straightforward for folks to
recreate much of their work in the new context, and that the level of new
benefits to be gained by doing so will justify such an effort.  Moreover, I
think that the work that's being done on BioMOO, JHM, MediaMOO, Astro-VR,
Jupiter and other systems, on understanding more and more about just what
people need from such an infrastructure and how to use it to help them do what
they want to do, is and will continue to be very important.  People are, I
think, learing important truths that transcend the specific underlying
technology and that will not only migrate to new infrastructures, but also help
to better inform the fundamental design of those new infrastructures; indeed,
there are countless ways in which our thinking about the Fabric has been
influenced in very basic ways by our collective experience with MUDs.

The upshot is that I encourage you to continue along this path you're all
walking right now; the research and (partially self-) education you're doing
will have value for many years to come.

I intend to add double-precision floating-point numbers as a new fundamental
MOO datatype, alongside the current integers, strings, lists, object
references, and error codes.  The plan is to more-or-less duplicate the level
of support described in the ANSI C standard within MOO, including
flexible string<-->number conversions and transcendental functions.  At least
currently, that's the full extent and limit of my plans.
